            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>MAny Learned Men have complained that Mr. <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave's Mathematical Jewel,</hi> (as he calls it) both the Inſtrument and the Book are rarely to be found. That the Book alſo by reaſon of the Interpolation of <hi>Gemma Friſius</hi> his precepts is longer then needed, and by reaſon of the Authors frequent interruptions by vexatious Suits in Law is ſomewhat confuſed; whereof himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains in his <hi>Preface to the Reader,</hi> and in the Concluſion of the Fourth Book, and elſwhere, wiſhing an amendment. At your requeſt eſpecially I undertook the reformation of that Treatiſe, which now at length I have ſimſhed. <hi>Gem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Friſius</hi> was the firſt that brought this Inſtrument to ſome good perfection, calling it <hi>Aſtrolabium Catholicum,</hi> but he did that by a <hi>Curſor</hi> and <hi>Brachialum</hi> which Mr <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> happily deviſed to perform by a <hi>Reet</hi> and <hi>Label</hi> with more eaſe and delight. I have no deſigne to deprave the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, or to obſcure the Names or Fame of thoſe ingenious Men, by whom this Inſtrument was contrived, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſo great perfection; but as Mr <hi>Blagrave</hi> ſaid when he took upon him to reform <hi>Gemma Friſius</hi> his Treatiſe; ſo I ſay of my laſt Edition of the Inſtrument after both, <hi>Facile eſt Inventis addore.</hi> Surely if men deceaſed have any knowledge or regard to what is done after them in this
<pb facs="tcp:101831:4"/>World, and could have communication with thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main here, I ſuppoſe Mr <hi>Blagrave's</hi> Ghoſt would give me, thanks for doing that which he heartily wiſhed to be done but for want of leaſure left unfiniſhed: and I ſhould like wiſe thank him by whoſe means I became acquainted with this excellent Inſtrument: which, next to the <hi>Sphear</hi> or <hi>Globe</hi> it ſelf, is the beſt Inſtrument, in my judgement, that ever was deviſed for <hi>Aſtronomy:</hi> and for the eaſier making and portableneſs, is to be preferred before the <hi>Sphear</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p>My aime hath been throughout this Treatiſe to Write Plainly, Methodically, and with as much brevity as might conſiſt with perſpicuity, remembring that of the <hi>Poet, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis eſſe laboro, Obſcurus fio.</hi> How far I have attained my Intention, the Reader will judge. If this work ſhall be found uſefull to the World, the thanks is due to you, who firſt ingaged me in it, and for the furtherance thereof took the pains to delineate the Inſtrument for me with your own hands, in Braſs Plates of fifteen inches Diameter; which I eſteem very highly, both for the exactneſs of the work, and for the work-man's ſake, to whom for more then twenty Years paſt I am alſo many other wayes obliged. I confeſs I have been ſomewhat ſlow in performing my promiſe to you, becauſe this Treatiſe hath taken up onely my ſpare hours, which by reaſon of infirm health, and more neceſſary emploiments, are not many.</p>

This circle ſhall be the great Meridian paſſing through the Poles of the world, and alſo through the <hi>Zenith</hi> and <hi>Nadir</hi> of your Countrey; and is the bound by which all the Line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments of the <hi>Mater</hi> are incloſed. Draw two Diameters croſſing one another in the center at right angles, and dividing this Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian into his quarters, let one of theſe Diameters be A B the Axtree-line, the other C D the Equator or his Diameter: divide alſo every quarter of this Meridian into 90 equal parts or degrees.</p>
               <p>This Meridian onely of all the circles of the <hi>Mater,</hi> falleth out to be a full circle in this projection, becauſe the biſection of the Sphear is ſuppoſed here to be made in the plain thereof, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the eye is ſuppoſed to be the Pole thereof, and ſo equidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from every part thereof. The reſt of the Meridians and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels their Semicircles are in this <hi>Planiſphere</hi> fore-ſhortned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Optique reaſon, (as ſhall be further explained Ch 2) becauſe they all either are great circles paſſing through the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, and cutting the Meridian at Right angles, as the Axtree-line or Eaſt Meridian, the Equator, and the Ecliptique, which are therefore projected upon their Diameters and become ſtraight lines; or elſe lie Oblique to the eye, as do all the reſt of the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and Parallels, which are all of them projected into arches leſs then a ſemicircle; and yet every one of them is to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſemicircle fore ſhortned, and to be divided as a ſomicircle into 180 degrees.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To deſcribe the reſt of the Meridians, you ſhall lay a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler from the Pole A to the ſeveral degrees of the ſemicircle C B D (or from the Pole B to the ſeveral degrees of the ſemicir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101831:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>C A D, for all comes to one) and mark where the Ruler interſects the Equinoctial line C D for every degree; ſo ſhall you have the Equinoctial divided into 180 deg. (<hi>viz.</hi> 90 degr. on one ſide the center, and 90 degr. on the other) through which diviſions or degrees the ſeverall Meridians ſhall paſs, and all of them muſt meet in both the Poles. Therefore having three points given for every Meridian (<hi>viz.</hi> the two Poles A and B, and a middle point in the Equator C D, bring theſe three points into a circle, and you ſhall have the true arch of every Meridian drawn on the Planiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phear; as they appear in this Projection: which how to do ſhall be further ſhewed Chap. 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3 To deſcribe the Parallels, you ſhall firſt divide the Axtree-line A B into 180 deg. (as you divide the Equator C D) by laying your Ruler from C or D to the ſeveral degrees of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Semicircle, and marking where the Ruler interſects the Axtree-line A B; or with your Compaſſes transfer the diviſion of the Diameter C D to the Diameter A B; ſo ſhall you have three points given for every Parallel, whereby his arch may be drawn: as for example, the tenth Parallel North ſhall be drawn from the tenth degr. of the Quadrant D A, counted from D, by the tenth diviſion of the Semidiameter E A, counted from E, to the tenth degr. of the Quadrant C A, counted from C: and ſo of the reſt. The Tropiques and Poler circles are deſcribed as the Parallels. Yet of them ſee Chap. 6.</p>
               <p n="4">4 To deſcribe the Ecliptick, number his greateſt Declination (23 degr. 30 mi.) in the Meridian from C, towards A to F. and again from D toward B to G; then joyn the points F and G with a ſtraight line which ſhall paſs through the center of the <hi>Mater</hi> and be the Ecliptick. For dividing whereof you ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transfer the diviſion of the Axtree-line or Equator upon this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick line (for all Diameters have like diviſions) and you ſhall diſtinguiſh every tenth and 30 degr. by longer ſtroaks, and ſhall ſet ♑ at G; ♈ and ♎ at the center; ♋ at F: and the reſt in their order.</p>

               <p>FOr the better underſtanding of the reaſon of this Declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either take or ſuppoſe to your ſelf an hollow Sphear or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101831:6"/>Globe, of equal diameter with your great Meridian before drawn. Cut this Sphear by the Meridian into two diſhes or Hemiſphears, the one repreſenting the Eaſtern, the other the Weſtern Hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phear of the Heaven: So in each of theſe Hemiſphears the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian is an whole Circle, being the Baſe of the Hemiſphear, or brim of the diſh: but the reſt of the Meridians, the Parallels, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial, and Ecliptick, are all biſected by the great Meridian, and ſo you can have but half their circles in the Eaſtern Hemiſphear, and the other half is in the Weſtern.</p>
               <p>Next ſuppoſe alſo the plain A C B D, to be a thin plate of ſome tranſparent matter, as clear horn glaſs, or chriſtal; and this plate fitted to ſtick in the diſh mouth (that is, in the Meridian of the Hemiſphear) and upon the center E a ſtraight wyre to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected perpendicular to the plain A C B D, and the length of the ſaid wyre to be equal to the ſemidiameter E A. Now place your eye at the top of this wyre and look up the Lineaments of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphear through the glaſs plate, and obſerve where the viſual lines drawn from the ſeverall points of the Hemiſphear to the eye cut the glaſs and what kind of lines and arches they do paint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the glaſs, and you ſhall ſee there that the ſemicircles of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator, the Eaſt Meridian, and the Ecliptick, will be depainted on the glaſs in ſtraight lines; becauſe they be great Circles, and paſs through the eye point of this projection) and the lines paſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your eye and the ſeveral degrees of any of them ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide their Diameters upon the glaſs into ſuch parts as they are divided by the precept of the former Chapter. For the top of the wyre (here ſuppoſed to be the Weſt point of the Horizon) is the true eye point from which the Diameters A B and C D are divided, and from which the whole projection of the Eaſtern Hemiſphear is made at one view upon the glaſs But becauſe this concave Hemiſphear with his wire or Axis erect, cannot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be pictured on a flat, therefore to ſupply the want of a ſolid Sche m you may conſider that the Axtree line A B is not onely the Diameter of the Eaſt Meridian, but a common Diameter to all the Meridians: and therefore if you take your ey point at C or D, and by your eye beam or a ruler laid from one of thoſe points to all the degrees of the oppoſite ſemicircle do divide the Axtree line, it ſhall be all one as if you had divided him from the top of the wire by the degrees of the Eaſt Meridian which paſſeth through the bottom of the concave Hemiſphear. For all great

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> How to find the centers of the <hi>Meridians</hi> five ſeveral wayes.</head>
               <p>THe centers of the Meridians and their ſemidiameters are thus found,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. You have by the firſt Chap. three points given by which they muſt be drawn <hi>(viz.)</hi> the two Poles, and a third point in the Equator) and how to bring theſe into a circle or arch, is ſhewed by <hi>Euclid.</hi> 4, 5. But I think this way incomodious for this purpoſe.</item>
                  <item>2 A better way is to get the centers by proffers, thus,</item>
               </list>
               <p>Let it be required to draw the twentieth Meridian whoſe points given are A 2 B. Having firſt extended infinitely the line C D, ſet one foot of your Compaſſes at adventure, in the line C D, whereabout you gueſs the center ſhould be, and extending the other foot to A or B, carry it about at the ſame extent towards 2, and if it touch the point 2, you have taken the true center, and may draw the arch as is required, if your Compaſs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach, you muſt narrow it, and come nearer; if it reach ſhort, widen your Compaſs, and ſeek your center further, till by tryal you light upon it: if one foot of your Compaſs ſtand in the line C D, and the other cut the middle point, and one of the extream points A or B, it ought to cut the other alſo; if your plain be flat, and the line C D ſtraight and ſquare to the line A B: but if any of theſe have failed, you ſhall never bring the three points into an arch while the foot of your compaſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>andeth in the line C D. Therefore in ſuch caſe ſet one foot in A, and draw with the other foot a ſhort arch croſſing the line C D; then ſet the ſtanding foot in B, and with the running foot croſs the ſhort arch laſt drawn: where theſe arches croſs will be the center, by which you may draw an arch cutting A and B, and if it cut 2 alſo, you have your deſire. But if this arch over reach 2, widen your Compaſs: if it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101831:7"/>come ſhort of 2 (the middle point) narrow your Compaſs, and try again in like manner till you can compaſs all the three points in the ſame arch.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third way. I ſuppoſe you may know that every Meridian cuts the Equator twice, <hi>viz.</hi> in two oppoſite points diſtant 180 degr. one from another: as, for example, the Meridian which cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Equator in 60 degr. of Right Aſcenſion, cuts it again in the oppoſite degr, <hi>viz.</hi> 240. Now if you can find theſe two points in the Equator line C D, the center will be in the juſt middle betwixt them. One of theſe points is already given within the fundamental Circle; the other without, is thus found. Prolong your Equator infinitely beyond your plate both wayes, and divide the extenſion thereof by like reaſon as you divided his Diameter, <hi>viz.</hi> as by a Ruler laid from A to the ſeveral deg. of the Quadrant B C, you devided the Semidiameter E C into 90 degr. ſo keeping ſtill one end of your Ruler fixed at A, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying about the other end thereof to the ſeverall degrees of the Quadrant C A, you may divide the excurrence of the line E C into 90 degr. more: and ſo E C and his exccurrence or continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be half the Equator divided into his degr. and E D with his excurrence on the other ſide will be the other half divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by like reaſon. And thus the whole Equator is projected in one ſtraight line, and divided into degr. alſo. Then having a point given within your fundamental circle through which the ſixtieth Meridian muſt paſs (<hi>viz</hi> the 60 deg. of the Semidimeter E C or E D) number thence over the center to 180 deg. and there is the point where the other ſemicircle muſt croſs, and the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe points is the center. But becauſe the two points taken in the quadrant A C are very near together, eſpecially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards A, and the Ruler alſo will croſs the prolongation of the line E C very obliquely, you may therefore do better to divide this line into his degr. by a Scale of Tangents, for if upon the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial line D E C you prick down from E both wayes the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents of the half degr. in order from 0, to 90, thoſe pricks ſhall be the whole degr. of the Equinoctial line in this Projection, to be numbred from E both wayes to 180 deg. where the Tangent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes infinite. Thus taking A E for Radius, E D is the Tangent of 45 deg. by the ſtructures: yet the arch or Diameter E D is a Quadrant or 90 deg. of the Equinoctial in this Projection, becauſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101831:7"/>the Tangents of the half deg. of the Quadrant E A I, meaſure out the whole degr. of the line E D, as was above-ſaid.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If you conſider well what hath been ſaid, you will find (or you may take it here upon truſt,) that for the 90 Meridians to be drawn between C and E, half the centers will be found in the oppoſite Semidiameter E D, and the other half without D in the ſaid Semidiameter prolonged. And that every ſecond di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the line E D from E toward D and forwards, ſhall be the centers of the Meridians which cut the Semidiameter C E. As for example, to draw every fifth Meridian from C to E, you take every tenth deg. from E toward D for the centers.</p>
               <p>And further if you would not be at more trouble then needs, to divide the extenſion of the Diameter beyond the fundamental circle, you ſhall but do thus. Begin with the crookedeſt Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians firſt, whoſe centers are within the fundamental Circle, and firſt pitching one foot of your Compaſs in the point 1, (near E) extend the other foot beyond the center to 2; there is the center from which you ſhall draw the firſt Meridian A 1 B: and alſo turning about your Compaſs you ſhall make a marke in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion beyond D at 1, where the other Semicircle of this Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an would croſs the Equator. So for the next Meridian, in the line C E marked with 2, your center is beyond E at 4, and after you have drawn his arch A 2 B, marke with your compaſs his other croſſing at 2 beyond D, and ſo with one labour you ſhall both draw the 45 crookeder Meridians, and alſo make the out lying diviſion of the line E D prolonged: of which diviſion every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or even number will be a center to ſome of the ſtraighter Meridians. This is a very good and eaſie way: and this way Mr <hi>Blagrave</hi> alwaies uſed.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Or laſtly You may frame a decimal Scale of 1000 or 10000 parts, equal to the Semidiameter of the <hi>Mater;</hi> by which Scale with the help of the Cannon of Triangles, you may preſently find the length of any S ne Tangent or Secant you ſhall deſire. Now look what inclination any Meridian hath to your fundamental Circle (that is, what angle they make between them) the Secant of that inclination is the Semidiameter of that Meridian; and the Tangent of the ſame inclination is the diſtance of his center from E the center of the <hi>Mater.</hi> For example, the Meridian A 2 B his inclination is 20 deg (for the angle C A 2 and likewiſe the arch C 2 which meaſures it is 20 degr. the S cant of 20 degr is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101831:8"/>10641. by the Cannon of Triangles (which every Mathematician ought to have at hand) Take with your Compaſſes from your decimal Scale 10641. and ſetting one foot in A, with the other foot croſs the Semidiameter E D; in that croſſing is the center: or take with your Compaſſes 3639. the Tangent of 20 degr. and ſet it from E toward D, and it ſhall give you the ſame center at 4. For A E being Radius, E 4 is the Tangent, and A 4 the Secant of 20 deg. by the ſtructure.</p>
               <p>And if you like to work this way, it will help you much to have a ſhort Cannon of Tangents and Secants of whole degr. of the Quadrant gathered into one page: which Cannon for your eaſe is here annexed.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. IIII.</hi> To find the Centers of the Parallels, ſix ſeveral wayes.</head>
               <p>THe firſt way, but the worſt for our purpoſe, (as was ſaid before for the Meridians) is by the fifth Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the fourth book of <hi>Euclid;</hi> to find the Center of the Circle circumſcribing the Triangle made by the three points given.</p>
               <p n="2">2 A better way is by profers. Take this upon truſt: that as you found the Centers of all the Meridians in the Equator, ſo ſhall you find the Centers of all the Parallels in the Axtree line prolonged, and by making like profers as you were taught for the Centers of the Meridians, (Chap. 3.) you may quickly find the Centers of the Parallels.</p>
               <p n="3">3 A third way. You muſt conſider that the Axtree line repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Eaſt Meridian as well as the Axis of the world which is a common Diameter to all the Meridians. Alſo that every Parallel cuts the Eaſt Meridian (as it doth the reſt) in two points Equidiſtant from the Equinoctial and two Equidiſtant alſo from the Poles. Therefore having one point already given in the Axtree line within the fundamental Circle where the Parallel ſhall cut, number the diſtance from this point to the next Pole, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber alſo the ſame diſtance again beyond the Pole in the Axtree-line prolonged, (being divided alſo as you were taught to divide the Equator line Chap. 3. and at the end of this number ſhall the Parallel out the Axtree line again. And the middle between theſe two ſections is the Center. For example, the 50th Parallel is 40 degr. diſtant from the Pole. Count therefore in the Axtree line prolonged 40 degr. beyond the Pole, and there is the utter end of this Parallels Diameter; which if you part in two, the middle at G is the Center.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If from the point given, where the Parallel cuts the great Meridian, you raiſe a Tangent line, this Tangent ſhall cut the Axtree line in the Center of the Parallel. Example, The ſaid 50th Parallel cuts the great Meridian at H, there I raiſe the Targent H G perpendicular to the Radius E H. And this Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent as you ſee cuts the Axtree line in G the Center of the Parallel.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Hence ariſeth a fifth way. For it appears by this figure
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101831:9"/>that the Tangent of the Parallels diſtance from the Pole is equal to his Semidiameter: and that the Secant of his diſtance from the Pole is equal to the diſtance of his Center, from the Center of the great Meridian. For here E H is Radius, H B an arch of 40 degr. H G the Tangent thereof, and Semidiameter of the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel, E G the Secant thereof, and the diſtance of the Center of the Parallel from the Center of the Meridian. And all this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the ſtructure in the Scheam. Wherefore making E H Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, take from your Scale or Sector, with your Compaſſes the Secant of the Parallels diſtance from the Pole, and ſet it from E in the Axtree line, and it ſhall end in the Center of the Parallel. Or take the Tangent of the Parallels diſtance from the Pole, and ſet it from the point of his Section with the Meridian toward the extenſion of the Axtree line, and where the end of it juſt toucheth the Axtree line, there is the Center.</p>
               <p n="6">6 For want of a Sector, or other fit Scales of Tangents and Secants you may do thus: Set one foot of your Compaſs in the Center E, and extend the other upon the Diameter of the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor or Axtree line, to twice ſo many degr. as your Parallel is diſtant from the Pole. That diſtance is the very Tangent you ſeek. For example, for the 40th Parallel from the Pole, I number from E toward D 80 degr. to 8. now E 8 is the Tangent of 40 degr. (though it contain juſt twice ſo many degr. of the Circle foreſhortned in this projection: as hath been ſhewed Chap. 3. Sect. 3.) and ſo if you will have the Secant of 40 degr. take with your Compaſſes the length from 8 (where the Tangent ends) to A. and that is the Secant to be uſed as was taught in the laſt Section.</p>
               <p>Thus have you wayes enough for finding the Centers of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians and Parallels. And you may have occaſion in the making of the Inſtrument to uſe moſt of them one time or other. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the knowledge of them is both pleaſant, and uſefull for the right underſtanding of this and other Projections of the Sphear, as alſo for the examination of your work, when you ſhall chance to doubt of it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V,</hi> How to draw the ſtraighter <hi>Meridians</hi> and <hi>Parallels,</hi> whoſe Semidiameters are very long.</head>
               <p>IT may trouble you very much to draw thoſe Meridians and Parallels which lie near to the Diameters; becauſe they be arches of great Circles and require Compaſſes larger then you can well get, or manage when you have gotten them. Till you come to the 80th Meridian from the Limb, a Beam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs of a yard long will reach, if your <hi>Mater</hi> be not above a foot Diameter, and a longer Beam you cannot well manage, for it will be apt to tremble with it's own weight, and draw double lines, though it be made very thick and maſſie. But the 89th Meridian will require a Beam-compaſs of almoſt ten yards long: For his Semidiameter will contain the Semidiameter of the great Meridian 57 times. Therfore to draw the 10 laſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians and the 10 laſt Parallels, you may help your ſelf one of theſe wayes.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BEſides the 180 Parallels aboy ementioned, you have four more to draw before the <hi>Mater</hi> is finiſhed. <hi>viz.</hi> the two <hi>Tropiques,</hi> and the two <hi>Polar</hi> Circles; of which the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern is called the <hi>Arctique,</hi> and the other the <hi>Antarctique</hi> Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. How to draw theſe you are ſufficiently inſtructed Chap. 4. if you know but their Declination, for they be Parallels. The <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pique</hi> of <hi>Cancer</hi> declineth from the Equator toward the North Pole 23 degr. 30 min. and the <hi>Tropique</hi> of <hi>Capricorn</hi> declines as much toward the South Pole. The <hi>Arctique</hi> Circle declines Northward 66 degr. 30 min. and the <hi>Antarctique</hi> as much Southward. And theſe being drawn after the manner of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parallels, you have drawn all the lineaments of the <hi>Mater,</hi> And the better to adorn and diſtinguiſh them you ſhall with your Graver hatch every fifteenth Meridian: for they are hour lines. The South arch of the great Meridian A C B is the hour of Noon: and his North arch A D B, the hour of Midnight. Theſe need not be hatched, being the Semicircles of the great Meridian, or fundamental Circle, which contains all but the Axtree line A E B, which is the hour line of the ſixes, and the reſt of the hour lines counted from him both waies, would be hatched on both fides, to ſhew like a ragged ſtaff, for diſtinction ſake. Alſo every fifth Meridian (not being a fifteenth) you ſhall make a pricked line, not punching it with a round point, leſt you make your plate warp, but making many ſhort ſtrokes croſs the line with your Graver, which will be more conſpicuous. Every tenth Parallel alſo would be a ragged line, and the intermediate fifths pricked lines: likewiſe the <hi>Tropiques</hi> and <hi>Polar</hi> Circles would be pricked lines. Alſo if your plate be large, you may ſet figures to the hour lines, and to every tenth Meridian at the Equator: but if your plate be ſmal the diviſions of the <hi>Label</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied upon the Equator may ſupply the lack of them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of the</hi> Reet, <hi>or</hi> Nets</head>
               <p>HAving ſhewed you what belongs to the Fabrique of the firſt part of this Inſtrument called the <hi>Mater:</hi> A few words more will inſtruct you how to make the <hi>Reet,</hi> whoſe lineaments are for the moſt part the ſame.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Reet</hi> is a round plate of metal, or paſtboard, like unto the <hi>Mater,</hi> but of leſs Diameter: it muſt be well planiſhed and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; and the thinner the better, if it hold working it would not be thicker then a ſhilling, being of a foot Diameter. It is called the <hi>Reet</hi> or <hi>Rete,</hi> that is the <hi>Net,</hi> becauſe it muſt be pierced through, and made like unto a <hi>Net</hi> or Letteſs; that the lincaments of the <hi>Mater</hi> may be perceived through it. If we had a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent metall, much labour might here be ſaved. A clear Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn horn may ſerve for a ſmal Inſtrument, but for large Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is beſt to have it either of fine paſtboard, or, if you will go to the coſt, of metal cancelled; as ſhall be taught.</p>
               <p n="1">1 For the delineation of the <hi>Reet,</hi> firſt draw your fundament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Circle equal to the fundamental Circle of the Mater leaving a border or Limb without, of ſuch breadth as may receive the graduations of the Circle and figures ſet to them, which breadth may be three tenths of an inch, where the <hi>Reet</hi> is a foot in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter: draw likewiſe two Diameters A B, and C D, croſſing one another in the Center E at right Angles, and dividing the Circle into his four Quadrants, which you ſhall ſubdivide again into 90 degr. apeece, as you did in the <hi>Mater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 You ſhall inſcribe two arches, which ſhall repreſent the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircles of the <hi>Ecliptique,</hi> which ſhall meet at the points C and D of the Equator, and the middle points of theſe arches ſhall be found in the Diameter A B, thus. The Diameter A B being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided as before you were taught to divide the Diameters of the <hi>Mater,</hi> number from A toward the center E 23 degr. 30 min. and there make the point F, for ♑: and likewiſe number from B toward E 23 degr. 30 min. and there ſet the point K. for ♋. then join the points C F D in one arch, and the points C K D in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arch (as is taught Chap. 3) and your <hi>Ecliptique</hi> is drawn. But now you muſt make him a narrow <hi>Limb</hi> inward toward the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101831:11"/>Center, to receive the ſcale of his degr. and the characters of the Signes. And to divide him you ſhall do thus. Number in the Axtree line (A B, from F inwards 90 degr. there is the Pole of the arch C F D, to this Pole faſten one end of your ruler (having an ey-lid-hole in the edge for that purpoſe) and carrying about the other end over the ſeveral degr. of the Semicircle C A D, you ſhall cut the arch C F D into his correſpondent degrees. As if you lay the ruler from C to 10 degr. in the <hi>Limb</hi> toward A, it ſhall cut the <hi>Ecliptique</hi> in ♎ 10, and ſo of the reſt. Likewiſe for the other Semicircle C K D, find his Pole 90 degr. from K to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward F and A: and from that Pole by like reaſon, you ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Semicircle C K D by the diviſions of the Semicircle C B D. This is the beſt way.</p>
               <p>Or you way divide the <hi>Ecliptique</hi> by a Table of Right Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſions, thus. Lay your ruler from the Center E to 27 deg. 54 min. in the <hi>Limb,</hi> which is the Right Aſcenſion of ♉ 0. to be counted from D towards B, and the ruler ſhall at the ſame time cut the <hi>Ecliptique</hi> in ♉ 0, to which that Right Aſcenſion belongs, and ſo for any other deg. or you may defer the dividing of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptique,</hi> till you have finiſhed and cut out the <hi>Reet:</hi> and then if you ſet the line C D of the <hi>Reet,</hi> in A B the Axtree line of the <hi>Mater,</hi> the <hi>Ecliptique</hi> will lie among the Meridians of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and ſhall be ſo divided by the Parallels of the <hi>Mater,</hi> as the Meridians are divided by them. But my advice is that you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide your <hi>Ecliptique</hi> the firſt way, and you may uſe this for proof of your work at laſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The reſt of the lineaments of the <hi>Reet</hi> are the <hi>Azimuths,</hi> to be drawn as the Meridians of the <hi>Mater,</hi> and the <hi>Almicanters,</hi> to be drawn as the Parallels. Onely you ſhall need to draw but half the <hi>Almicanters,</hi> and the <hi>Azimuths</hi> but half way, leaving one half of your <hi>Reet viz.</hi> E C B D blank and void of them.</p>
               <p>In drawing theſe <hi>Azimuths</hi> and <hi>Almicanters</hi> you ſhall be carefull to skip over the border of the <hi>Ecliptique,</hi> leaving it fair, that the graduations thereof with their figures ſet to every tenth degr. and the characters of the Signes may be more diſtinctly ſeen. Alſo you ſhall do well, if you make a border to the Axtree line on the Northſide, that is toward D, and let this border be of the ſame breadth from A to B, the breadth not exceeding one fifth of an inch in a <hi>Reet</hi> of a foot Diameter; upon which border you may make a ſcale of degrees, ſetting figuresin it to every tenth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101831:11"/>
                  <hi>Almicanter.</hi> This will be a great ſtrength and Ornament to your <hi>Reet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Below the Horizon C D likewiſe, you ſhall make a <hi>Limb</hi> or border for the Horizon, to receive his graduations: this may be a quarter or three tenths of an inch broad, where the <hi>Reet</hi> is a foot in Diameter: and upon this border you ſhall ſet figures at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tenth <hi>Azimuths,</hi> and ſhall number them both wayes, from the Center and from the Meridian.</p>
               <p n="4">4 You ſhall inſcribe ſo many of the fixed Stars as your <hi>Reet</hi> may well receive. Which to do you muſt know their Right Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſions (or Culminations) and alſo their Declinations, for which purpoſe I have given you a Table of 110 of the more notable fixed Stars, (which may beſt be inſerted in your <hi>Reet,</hi>) with their Right Aſcenſions and Declinations calculated to the year of our <hi>Lord</hi> 1671. which may ſerve for 40 years before and after with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſiderable error.</p>
               <p>To inſcribe them you ſhall firſt number the Right Aſcenſion of the Star from ♈ 0, that is from D upon the <hi>Limb</hi> of the <hi>Reet</hi> toward B, and at the end of that number fix your <hi>Label,</hi> (which by this time ſhould be made and pinned on the Center,) then from the <hi>Limb</hi> count inwards upon the <hi>Label</hi> the Stars Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and at the end of that number make a prick in your <hi>Reet</hi> cloſe to the edge of the <hi>Label,</hi> there is the Stars place. Then with your Graver you ſhall make there the ſhape of a Star, with 4, 5, or 6 points, according as the magnitude of the Star deſerves: and let one point be longer then the reſt; and let it point outward from the Center, if the Stars Declination be North, but inward toward the Center, if his Declination be South: and let the end of his long point (called <hi>Apex</hi>) be in the very true place of the Star. But if your <hi>Label</hi> be yet unmade, then take the meaſure of the Stars Declination with your Compaſſes upon any of the four Semidiameters of the <hi>Reet,</hi> (meaſuring it from the <hi>Limb</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,) then lay a ruler from the Center to the Right Aſcention of the Star and where the ruler cuts the <hi>Limb</hi> of the <hi>Reet;</hi> there ſet one foot of your Compaſſes, (opened as before) and with the other make a prick toward the Center, cloſe to the edge of your ruler, and there is the Stars place in your <hi>Reet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 Laſtly, you ſhall cut out all the ſpaces of this <hi>Reet,</hi> which may be ſpared; remembring alwaies that you leave uncut the borders of the <hi>Ecliptique,</hi> Horizon, and Axtree line, and be very
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101831:12"/>carefull that you cut not into the Center of your <hi>Reet,</hi> but leave breadth ſufficient about the Center to hold the Center-pin, which muſt joyn <hi>Mater Reet</hi> and <hi>Label</hi> together. This remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, you ſhall cut out two third parts of the ſpaces of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micanters, beginning from the Horizon C D, and cutting out the breadth of two degrees, after which you ſhall leave the breadth of one degree; and then cut our again the breadth of two degrees, and ſo forward. But for the greater ſtrength and ornament of your <hi>Reet,</hi> and for eaſe in numbring the <hi>Azimuths,</hi> you ſhall at every 15th <hi>Azimuth</hi> leave a ſtring of the breadth of one degree, whole from the Horizon to the Pole A, or at every thirtieth <hi>Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth</hi> leave ſuch a ſtring going quite through, and at every other fifteenth the ſtring may be cut off when it comes within ten degr. of the Pole, becauſe there the ſpaces of the <hi>Azimuths</hi> be very narrow and cloſe together.</p>
               <p>And where among thoſe <hi>Almicanters</hi> and <hi>Azimuths</hi> you have any Star, you muſt contrive to leave him ſtanding, and to ſet by him his name or ſome figure by which you may know him again. But you are to content your ſelf with four Stars on this ſide the Horizon, becauſe you will want convenient room. On the other ſide you may have more, and room alſo to writ their names upon ſtrings or branches left for that purpoſe; which you may contrive into ſome voluntary letteſs-work, wherein you ſhall not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard uniformity of the Quadrants, but to make the <hi>Reet</hi> as open as you can, provided you leave it of ſufficient ſtrength.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Of the</hi> Ring, <hi>or</hi> Limb <hi>of the</hi> Mater.</head>
               <p>THe third part of this Inſtrument is the <hi>Ring</hi> or <hi>Limb,</hi> which is nothing elſe but the skirt of a Circular plate equal with the <hi>Mater,</hi> whoſe middle is cut out by a leſſer concentrique Circle. It is bounded with two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel Circles, the outmoſt muſt touch the edge of the <hi>Mater</hi> round the inner Circle or edge of this Ring: it muſt be a little leſs then the <hi>Limb</hi> of the <hi>Reet,</hi> that it may take hold of the <hi>Reet</hi> to keep it flat and ſafe from harms. This Ring had need be thicker then the <hi>Reet,</hi> but not ſo thick as the <hi>Mater;</hi> and for breadth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 1/10 part of the Diameter. It muſt be pinned or ſcrewed on to the <hi>Mater</hi> with 6 or 8 pinnes or ſcrews, that ſo you may take your plates aſunder when need is to cleanſe them from any ſtain or duſt that may get between. Let the pins that carry the naile-ſcrews be riverted in the <hi>Ring,</hi> and chair heads ſo filed down and poliſhed, that they be not ſeen to check the <hi>Label:</hi> and holes being made in the <hi>Mater</hi> for the pins to paſs through, you ſhall have ſmal ſcrews of what faſhion you like beſt, to turn upon them on the backſide; theſe ſcrews would be made all of a length, and may ſerve as feet to bare up the Inſtrument about a third part of an inch from the ground, that it be not ſcratched and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to take up.</p>
               <p>And that the <hi>Reet</hi> may turn more pleaſantly under the <hi>Ring,</hi> and lie as near as may be in the ſame plain with the <hi>Ring,</hi> you ſhall abate half the thickneſs of the upper edge of the <hi>Reet,</hi> about a barly-corn's breadth round about, ſo far as he ſhall run under the <hi>Ring</hi> and likewiſe aba e half the thickneſs of the inner edge of the <hi>Ring</hi> on the lower ſide where he claſps down the <hi>Reet,</hi> (which a good Turner knowes now to do;) or you may make a ſhift to do it with a beam-compaſs, if you make your running point like a narrow cheſill.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>Ring</hi> thus fitted to the <hi>Mater,</hi> you ſhall ſet one foot of your Compaſſes in the Center of the <hi>Mater,</hi> and with the other draw near the inner edge of the <hi>Limb</hi> a Circle about 8/100 of an inch diſtant from the edge. Alſo opening your Compaſſes about ⅙ of an inch more you ſhall draw another Parallel Circle: and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101831:15"/>laying your Ruler or <hi>Label</hi> from the Center to the ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the fundamental Circle of the <hi>Mater,</hi> you ſhall draw ſhort lines for every degree from the inner edge of the <hi>Ring</hi> to the firſt Circle, and every tenth degree you ſhall prolong to the ſecond Circle, and let every fifth be drawn half way. Between theſe two Circles alſo you ſhall ſet figures to every tenth degree; numbring from the Equinoctial line C D to the Poles on both ſides both wayes. Alſo without the ſecond Circle you ſhall ſet great figures for the ſeveral Hours, ſetting XII at C, and thence proceeding in order to the right hand toward B, at 15 degrees ſet I, at 30 degr. ſet II, at 45 degr, ſet III, and ſo on, till you come to D, where you muſt ſet XII. Thence you ſhall proceed in the other Semicircle D A C, ſetting I, II, III, and ſo on in order, till you be come round. And remember that you write on the <hi>Ring,</hi> at A <hi>Oriens,</hi> at C <hi>Meridies:</hi> at B <hi>Occidens,</hi> and at D <hi>Septentrio.</hi>

               <p>IF there be ſpace enough left upon the <hi>Ring</hi> without the Circles of the degrees and Hours, you may fill it up with the <hi>Ephemeris</hi> of the Sun in this manner:</p>
               <p>The former Scale on the inner edge of the <hi>Ring</hi> ſhall ſerve you to this purpoſe for an <hi>Ecliptique;</hi> and you may ſet to him the Characters of the Signes, if you will, at every thirtieth degree; beginning at <hi>Oriens</hi> and there ſetting ♈, and ♋ at <hi>Meridies,</hi> and the reſt in like order.</p>
               <p>Then draw another Scale without this, upon the <hi>Ring,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of two ſpaces. In the inner ſpace ſhall be the Dayes of the Year: in the outer ſpace: which muſt be a little larger) ſhall be the Names of the moneths in their order.</p>
               <p>And to divide this Scale rightly, you ſhall do thus. Go to ſome <hi>Eſhemeris</hi> for the Leap Year that next comes, <hi>viz.</hi> 1660, (or rather for ſome Leap Year about 20 Years hence, that your Scale may ſerve without any <hi>Proſthaphereſis,</hi> for 40 Years to come without ſenſible error, and beginning your year with <hi>March,</hi> look where the Sun was on the 29 of <hi>February</hi> at Noon; which you ſhall find to be ♓ 20 degr. 47 min, for the Year 1660. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laying the <hi>Label</hi> or a Ruler from the center to ♓ 20 degr.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101831:16"/>47 min. in the inner Scale, ſtrike a long ſtroke through your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Scale, and from thence begin your Year, writing from thence toward the right hand <hi>March</hi> 1660. Then lay the <hi>Label</hi> to ♓ 21 degr. 47 min, (which is the Suns place on the firſt day of <hi>March</hi> at noon the ſame year) and where it cuts the outer Scale, mark the firſt day of <hi>March,</hi> and ſo the reſt in order. And to the firſt day of every moneth, you ſhall ſet his proper Letter which belongs to him in the <hi>Calender;</hi> as to the firſt of <hi>March</hi> you ſhall ſet D, and to the firſt of <hi>April</hi> G, &amp;c. and when you have done <hi>December,</hi> you muſt take the Suns place for <hi>January</hi> and <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> out of the next years <hi>Ephemeris, viz.</hi> 1661, and note that the ſpace for the laſt day of the year (<hi>Febr.</hi> 28) will fall out to be leſs by a fourth part then the reſt, by reaſon that the Sun wants almoſt 6 hours to finiſh his Circle, which he finiſhes in dayes 365, 5 hours 48 minutes. And for this cauſe theſe Scales will ſerve you to find the Suns place at noon, for any day in a like year, that is every fourth year, accounted hence, either backwards or forwards; which year ſhall evermore be accounted to begin from <hi>Febr.</hi> 29. and may be accounted the firſt year after Leap year, becauſe the Intercalation was <hi>February</hi> 25 next before. Then for the year next following, <hi>viz,</hi> 1661. (beginning <hi>March</hi> 1 and being ſecond from the <hi>Biſſextile</hi> or Leap year) theſe Scales ſhall give you the place of the Sun at ſix hours after noon, and the third year from <hi>Biſſextile</hi> 1662 (beginning as before <hi>March</hi> 1) theſe Scales ſhall give you the Suns place 12 hours after noon, or the midnight following. And the fourth year 1663 being <hi>Biſſextile,</hi> theſe Scales ſhew the place of the Sun at 18 hours after noon, the next year 1664, being the firſt after <hi>Biſſextile,</hi> and beginning (as aforeſaid) <hi>March</hi> 1, is the very ſame year for which your Scale is made and gon, for that year: your Scale ſhewes the Suns place at noon again.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the <hi>Julian</hi> years are bigger then the true Solar years by almoſt 12 mi. of time (that is, near a quarter of an hour) in which time the Sun moves 27 ſec. 13 thirds 37 fourths, therefore when you have found the Suns place by the former Scale, any year after 1660, look how many years are paſſed ſince 1660 and ſo many times you muſt add 27 ſec. 13 thirds 37 fourths, (that is almoſt half a minute) to the Suns place found: and for years paſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ou muſt ſubtract as much, that you may find the Suns place exactly. This <hi>Proſthaphereſis</hi> in 2 or 3 years is ſcarce conſiderable
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101831:16"/>in an Inſtrument, but in 10 years there will be 4 minutes 32. ſeconds, and in 20 years 9. minutes 5. ſeconds, to be added after 1660. and as much to be ſubtracted in like number of years preceding the year 1660. to which this Scale is ſuppoſed to be framed.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Ephemeris</hi> or <hi>Calender</hi> M. <hi>Blagrave</hi> would have on the back-ſide, where hee would alſo have a Ruler with Sights, to take the Altitude of the Sun or Stars. But this will be found incommodious in many reſpects, both in the framing, and in the uſing; and therefore I adviſe that nothing be ſet on the back-ſide but the Tables of the <hi>Prime, Epact,</hi> and <hi>Cycle of the Sun,</hi> thereby to find the age of the Moon, her Conjunctions and Oppoſitions, and the moveable Feaſts for ever, Of which ſee Chap. 11.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Of the</hi> Label <hi>and</hi> Sights.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Label</hi> is a Ruler ſlit in the mideſt, and the half of it cut away to the Head, where it is pinned to turn upon the Center, and reaching to the outſide of the Limb. The Fiducial edge thereof, which pointeth upon the Center, muſt be graduated, like to the ſemidiameters of the <hi>Mater</hi> and <hi>Reet,</hi> into 90 degrees, to be numbred either inward or outward. The faſhion of it may be underſtood by the figure without more words.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Label</hi> you may fit Sights, either fixed or moveable, as you like beſt, for obſerving <hi>Altitudes</hi> and <hi>Azimuths:</hi> but for taking. <hi>Azimuths</hi> you had need have one tall Sight, at leaſt half as long as the <hi>Label:</hi> and then it had need be movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to take off at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>For taking the <hi>Altitude</hi> of the Sun, I have made a pair of moveable Sights, to ſlip up and down upon the edge of the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſphear;</hi> having on the backſide ſpringing plates of braſs to pintch them cloſe, and make them ſtick where you ſet them. Theſe are commonly to be ſet at C and D the ends of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial line. At A in the <hi>Limb</hi> and in the Circle next unto the inner edge which boundeth the ſtrokes of the ſeverall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, you ſhall drill a ſmall hole, through which you may put
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101831:17"/>a thred to hang a plummet on. The Sun then ſhining through the Sights placed at C and D, the plumb-line ſhall ſhew his Altitude in the ſemicircle B C A, you beginning to number from B, and obſerving where the plumb-line croſſeth the Circle in which the hole for hanging the plumb-line was made. And here you muſt remember that becauſe the plumb-line falleth not from the Center of the <hi>Planiſphear,</hi> but from a point in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about A, therefore the ſpace of two degrees muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken but one degree, ſo that if the Plumb-line fall 20 degr. below B toward C, the Suns <hi>Altitude</hi> is 10, degrees as you may ſee demonſtrated, <hi>Euclid.</hi> 3.20. and <hi>Pitiſc. Trigonem.</hi> 1.53. And thus you may obſerve the Suns <hi>Altitude</hi> neer the Horizon, as exactly as by a <hi>Quadrant,</hi> whoſe ſemediameter were equal to the diameter of your <hi>Planiſphear.</hi> But if the <hi>Altitude</hi> exceed 30 or 40. degrees then will the Plumb-line cut the limb too ſlope and have too much play to your trouble: For remedy whereof you ſhall remove the Sight at D towards A ſome degrees: as for example 60 degrees, by which means you ſhall abate the Suns <hi>Altitude</hi> 30 degrees, which 30 degrees muſt be added to the <hi>Altitude</hi> obſerved: as for example, the Sights are placed one at C, the other 60 degrees above D toward A, and the Plumb-line cuts 10 degrees from B towards C, I ſay, then is the Sun 5 degrees high and 30 degrees more, in all 35 degrees: in like manner you may place the Sight at any other number of degrees from D toward A, as you ſhall find moſt convenient for the preſent <hi>Altitude;</hi> remembring always that how many degrees ſoever you remove the Sight, half ſo many are to be added to the <hi>Altitude</hi> found. But if your <hi>Reet</hi> happen to run ſo far under the <hi>Limb,</hi> that you cannot make a center-hole for the Plumbet through the <hi>Limb</hi> and <hi>Mater,</hi> without hindring the <hi>Reets</hi> motion, then may you have a ſmall plate of ſheet braſs, in faſhion of an Arm or Tongue, in the point whereof you ſhall have a Center-hole drilled, and this plate ſhall be ſo joyned with a ſluce or ſcrew about the <hi>Limb</hi> near A, that the Center-hole made in this plate may lie cloſe to the point where the Center ſhould have been boared in the <hi>Limb</hi> in the line A B: and thus you may put it on, and take it off, at pleaſure, that it hinder not the motion of the <hi>Reet</hi> or <hi>Label.</hi> Of the faſhion of the Sights ſee more Booke 4.2.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the perpetual <hi>Calender,</hi> on the back-ſide.</head>
               <p>ON the back-ſide of your <hi>Planiſphear</hi> you may ſet the <hi>Calender</hi> following, which conſiſteth of three Tables gathered round. The longeſt would be ſet outtermoſt. The firſt is the Table of the <hi>Cycle of the Sun,</hi> that is of the <hi>Sundays Letter.</hi> This is here placed in the middle. It is a Cycle of 28. years, in which time the <hi>Dominical Letter</hi> runs all his changes, (cauſed by the one odd day above 52 weeks) in every Common year, and two odd days which run over the even weeks in the <hi>Leap years.</hi> To find the beginning of this Cycle, add to the year of our <hi>Lord</hi> 9. (becauſe the firſt year of our <hi>Lord,</hi> as wee commonly acount, was the 10 of this Cycle) and divide the ſum by 28. the remainder is the year of the Cycle running; and if nothing remain, then it is the 28. or laſt year. So you ſhall find that the Cycle now running ſhall end with the <hi>Julian</hi> year 1671 as in the Table; and ſhall begin again with the year of our <hi>Lord</hi> 1672. Thus may you renew the Table when it is expired; or make this very Table ſerve you for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Enter this Table with the year of our <hi>Lord</hi> 1656. now run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and you ſhaall find over againſt this year in the next ſpace inwards 13. ſhewing you that it is the 13 year of the Suns Cycle; (ſo ſhall the 28 year forward <hi>viz.</hi> 1684 be again the 13th year of the Cycle next comming.)</p>
               <p>In the next ſpace within, you have the <hi>Dominical Letters</hi> F and E, (becauſe it is <hi>Leap year</hi>) F ſhall be the <hi>Dominical Letter</hi> till you come paſt the <hi>Intercalary</hi> day, which is the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 24th of <hi>February:</hi> and for the reſt of this year the <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Letter</hi> ſhall be E; (for the Letters always change back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) alſo you ſhall note here that the day inſerted in every 4th year is not <hi>February</hi> 29, but <hi>February</hi> 25. for <hi>February</hi> 24. (being 6 <hi>Cal. Martij</hi>) is repeated again in the <hi>Leap year:</hi> and they write again <hi>February</hi> 25.6 <hi>Cal. Martij:</hi> and the 25th of <hi>February</hi> in the <hi>Leap year</hi> is marked with the ſame letter F,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101831:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>wherewith the 24th of <hi>February</hi> hapneth always to be marked. Hence the <hi>Leap year</hi> is called <hi>Annus Biſſextilis:</hi> and note that by the <hi>Ecleſiaſticall</hi> Law S. <hi>Matthias day,</hi> which is <hi>February</hi> 24th in common years, in the <hi>Biſſextile</hi> years is to be obſerved on <hi>February</hi> 25. Nevertheleſs in our Secular Law not the 24th and 25th of <hi>February.</hi> but the 28th and 29th in the Leap year are ordained to be one day in the account of Law: as by <hi>Statutum de Anno Biſſextili,</hi> made in 21 year <hi>Henry</hi> 3. may appear.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Table is of the <hi>Cycle of the Moon,</hi> conſiſting of the <hi>Prime</hi> or <hi>Golden Number,</hi> and the <hi>Epact.</hi> This Table contains 19 years, which is the <hi>Annus Metonicus:</hi> in which ſpace of time <hi>Meton</hi> an Aſtronomer about 430 years before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> obſerved the Moon to finiſh all her variations. So that every 19 year the mean conjunctions or changes ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen upon the ſame days of the moneth, that they did happen upon 19 years before; onely an hour and half ſooner. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eauſe every 19 years contain not the ſame number of <hi>Leap years,</hi> but ſometime there come five <hi>Leap years</hi> in 19 years, and ſometimes but four, therefore there may happen in this Period of <hi>Meton</hi> an error of an whole day, beſides the hour and half above mentioned. For remedy whereof <hi>Calippus,</hi> about the 330 year before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> deviſed to quadruple this period of <hi>Meton,</hi> making <hi>Period<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s Calippica</hi> of 76 years, which contains juſt 19 quaternions of years; ſo containing always the ſame number of <hi>Leap years</hi> and days. This period is therefore more perfect then <hi>Metons:</hi> for after this period of 76 years, the Moon runneth over the ſame courſe for her conjunctions and oppoſitions; changing in the ſame year of the period always, upon the ſame day of the moneth, ſave onely that ſhee changeth ſooner by ſix hours in the latter period then in the former.</p>
               <p>But the Church ſtill retaineth the period of <hi>Meton,</hi> called the <hi>Prime,</hi> or <hi>Golden number;</hi> becauſe it uſed to be ſet in Golden letters in the <hi>Kalender,</hi> in a certain artificiall order throughout every moneth, to guide you to the day of the Moons <hi>Priming</hi> or <hi>Changing:</hi> ſo may you find it in red letters, thus, Set to the <hi>Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> printed in large folio with the <hi>Book of common Prayer,</hi> in the time of the late Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> To find the year of the <hi>Prime,</hi> add to the year of our Lord 1, and divide the ſum by 19. the remainder is the year of the <hi>Prime,</hi> or if nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main it is the 19th or laſt year. Thus you may find the preſent
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101831:18"/>year 1656, to be the fourth year of the <hi>Prime,</hi> and ſo you find it in the Table. The <hi>Cycle</hi> or <hi>Period</hi> now running, ends with 1671. and begins again with the year following.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Epact</hi> or <hi>Concurrent</hi> is ſet againſt the <hi>Prime</hi> in the next ſpace inwards: and finiſheth his Cycle in the ſame time. It was deviſed to find more readily the day of the change, and age of the Moon. The way to find it is this. Multiply the <hi>Golden number</hi> ſerving for your year by 11, and divide the product by 30; the reſidue is the <hi>Epact</hi> for your year. Or having the <hi>Epact</hi> known for any year, you may make it from year to year, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding 11 to the <hi>Epact</hi> of the year foregoing, and caſting away 30 when the ſum exceeds 30. The reaſon whereof is, that the Moon changeth 12 times in 354. days, that is 11 days before the Sun hath gone his round: for which cauſe the changes muſt needs happen every year 11 days ſooner. Obſerve here that the <hi>Prime</hi> changeth every year the firſt day of <hi>January;</hi> the <hi>Epact</hi> not till the firſt of <hi>March.</hi> The <hi>Dominical letter</hi> changeth upon the firſt of <hi>January</hi> going one letter backward yearly; and in every <hi>Leap year</hi> it changeth again on the <hi>Lords day</hi> next after <hi>February</hi> 24. The reaſon whereof is this: The <hi>Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> is marked throughout with the letters of the week A B C D E F G, and the ſame day of the year is always marked with the ſame letter, now if the year contained even weeks then would the <hi>Dominical letter</hi> be always one and the ſame: but becauſe a common year contains 52 weeks and one day, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt day of the year muſt be marked with A, as the firſt was; the firſt day of the year following again is marked with A: now put caſe the laſt of <hi>December</hi> marked A, be <hi>Sunday</hi> in the year 1654. the day following <hi>viz January</hi> 1, is <hi>Munday,</hi> and yet marked A; and the firſt <hi>Sunday</hi> in 1655 muſt needs fall on <hi>January</hi> 7 marked with G: and ſo G became <hi>Dominical letter</hi> for 1655. as A was for 1654. and as thoſe 2 days mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame letter A, coming together at every years end cauſe a change of the <hi>Dominical letter,</hi> ſo in the <hi>Leap year</hi> the Intercalary day <hi>February the</hi> 25, being marked with F, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways as the 24th is, the coming together of thoſe two dayes marked with one letter, cauſeth a ſecond change of the <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal letter</hi> for that year by like reaſon.</p>
               <p>The third Table is a Table to find <hi>Eaſter</hi> for ever. This is placed outmoſt becauſe it is the longeſt. It was very falſly

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Some cautions to be Obſerved in the making of the <hi>Inſtrument.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THough I have taught the making of the <hi>Mater</hi> firſt as being the baſe and principal part of the <hi>Inſtrument;</hi> yet I ſhall adviſe you firſt to draw and cut out the <hi>Reet,</hi> and fit the <hi>Label</hi> to it, leaving it ſufficient length to reach to the out-ſide of the <hi>Mater.</hi> And then having your <hi>Ring</hi> ready fitted to ſcrew on to the <hi>Mater</hi> you ſhall drill the centers of the <hi>Mater, Reet,</hi> and <hi>Label,</hi> with the ſame drill; and faſten them together with a <hi>Center-pin</hi> well fitted to the bore: this <hi>Center-pin</hi> muſt not be too big: let it be ſquare at the head to ſtick in the backſide of the <hi>Mater,</hi> that it turn not; and let the other end have a male ſcrew, upon which you ſhall turn a female ſcrew, to draw the plates together; ſo that they be neither too looſe nor ſtick too hard. Then take a great needle, or ſuch a round point of hardned ſteel, and bearing it up into ſome corner of the <hi>Reet</hi> cloſe to the inſide of his <hi>Limb,</hi> turn about both <hi>Reet</hi> and Needle upon the <hi>Mater,</hi> ſo that the Needle may trace out the great Meridian of the <hi>Mater,</hi> and ſo the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Circles of the <hi>Mater</hi> and <hi>Reet</hi> ſhall be ſure to be Concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique, and to argree in all poſtures of the <hi>Reet:</hi> whereas if you draw the Meridian of the <hi>Mater</hi> before you have bored the Center, and fitted on the <hi>Reet,</hi> you ſhall hardly happen to bore ſo true, but you ſhall find the Circles to be a little Eccentrique and interfering one with another. And to avoid the like Eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity in the Circles of the <hi>Ring,</hi> it were beſt to have a ſorry Beam Compaſs made onely for this purpoſe, and fitted to your Center pin to draw them by: yet if thoſe be drawn from the Center of the <hi>Mater</hi> unbored, there will be no perceiveable error, if you devide them from the <hi>Limb</hi> of the <hi>Reet</hi> by the <hi>Label</hi> when all is pinned together. Theſe things done, quarter the Meridian of the <hi>Mater</hi> with two croſs Diameters, and divide them as is above directed; remembring to apply your <hi>Reet</hi> to the <hi>Mater</hi> often, to ſee how the diviſions of the Diameter agree, and how the Meridians and Parallels which you are drawing on the <hi>Mater</hi> agree with the <hi>Azimuths</hi> and <hi>Almicanters</hi> of the <hi>Reet.</hi> And thus by comparing your plates often, and examining the lineaments of the one by the other, as you draw them, you ſhall avoid many ſlips and miſtakes, and proceed in your work with more confidence and contentment.</p>

               <p>WHat M. <hi>Blagrave</hi> Book 2. Chap, 15.16. calleth the firſt and ſecond diſtinction of the <hi>Jewel,</hi> I call the firſt and ſecond Meridional and Equinoctial Projection of the <hi>Planiſphear,</hi> for which change of termes I hope the Judicious Reader will not blame me. The Meridional Projection is the Eaſtern or Weſtern <hi>Hemiſphear</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:101831:20"/>projected upon the plain of the Meridian of your place, which is the great and chief Meridian in every Country, paſſing through the <hi>Zenith</hi> and <hi>Nadir</hi> of the place, as well as through the Poles of the World. The eye in this Projection is ſuppoſed to be placed in the Eaſt or Weſt point of the Horizon. The lineaments which belong to this Projection are the innermoſt Scale of the <hi>Ring,</hi> and all the lineaments of the <hi>Mater</hi> and <hi>Reet,</hi> except only the <hi>Zodiack</hi> of the <hi>Reet,</hi> and the Stars. Here the outmoſt Circle both of the <hi>Mater</hi> and <hi>Reet</hi> repreſents the great Meridian of your place, and the Scale upon the inſide of the <hi>Ring</hi> divided into 360 degrees ſerveth to divide the ſaid Meridian: for the <hi>Label</hi> laid upon any degree of the Scale of the <hi>Ring</hi> cutteth the ſame degree in the Meridian Circle; becauſe it is concentrick thereto.</p>
               <p>This Meridian alſo ſtandeth for <hi>Colurus Solſtitiorum,</hi> (ſo they call that Meridian which paſſeth through the beginning of <hi>Cancer</hi> and <hi>Capricorn</hi>) for though all the Meridians in 24. hours ſpace do ſucceſſively come into the Meridian of your place (which is the Noon Circle paſſing over your head North and South) and the <hi>Sphear</hi> may be divided into Eaſtern and Weſtern <hi>Hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phear</hi> by any of theſe Meridians, when they become Vertical, yet the <hi>Sphear</hi> is then in the beſt poſture to be divided for our purpoſe into Eaſt and Weſt, when <hi>Cancer</hi> is Southing, <hi>Capricorn</hi> at midnight, and ♎ 0 riſing full Eaſt, and ♈ 0 ſetting full Weſt.</p>
               <p>In this Meridian at A, or <hi>Oriens</hi> is the North Pole, and the South Pole at B, or <hi>Occidens:</hi> for the words <hi>Oriens and Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> are there placed to ſerve the Equinoctial Projection. The Concurrent Circles meeting in the Poles A and B are Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians. Thoſe Meridians are 180 in number, and divide the Equator C D into 360. degrees, becauſe, every one of them cutteth it twice, that is once in each <hi>Hemiſphear.</hi> By theſe are numbred the Right Aſcenſions of the Stars and Planets, and the hours and minutes of Day and Night: for every 15 of theſe Meridians numbred from the <hi>Limb</hi> is an hour Circle, as hath been ſhewed (Book 1.6.) they are numbred from D to C, that is, from <hi>Septentrio</hi> to <hi>Meridies</hi> 1.2.3. &amp;c. for the Morning hours and back again from C to D, in like manner for the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon: the Axeltree line A B falling out to be the ſix a clock line both ways. By thoſe Meridians alſo are numbred the Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Towns and Countries in <hi>Geography.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Circles or Semicircles croſſing theſe Meridians are the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101831:21"/>Parallels of Declination: they are leſſer Circles whoſe propertie it is to divide the <hi>Sphear</hi> into unequal parts. In the midſt of them lies the Equator C D, being here a ſtraight line, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Axtree-line A B at Right Angles in the Center E: the Parallels are greateſt near the Equator, and from thence they leſſen toward the Poles, they are 180 in number <hi>i. e.</hi> 90 on each ſide the Equator, ſave that the two extream Parallels are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to two points in the Poles. By theſe Parallels are numbred the Declinations of the Stars in <hi>Aſtronomie,</hi> and the Latitudes of Towns and Countries in <hi>Geography.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this name and uſe have the Circles of the <hi>Mater</hi> always in the Meridional Projection. The <hi>Ecliptick</hi> always ſtandeth for it ſelf, when it is uſed, which is onely in the firſt Mode of this Projection.

                  <p>The point A of the <hi>Reet</hi> in which the Concurrent Arches meet, is called the <hi>Vertex</hi> of the <hi>Reet.</hi> Set the <hi>Vertex</hi> of the <hi>Reet</hi> to the Latitude of your place, ſo ſhall the <hi>Vertex</hi> be <hi>Zenith,</hi> and the Concurrent Arches there meeting ſhall be <hi>Azimuths,</hi> called alſo <hi>Vertical Circles,</hi> and <hi>Circles of Poſition,</hi> paſſing from <hi>Zenith</hi> to <hi>Nadir,</hi> and dividing the Horizon into 360 degr. as the Meridians on the <hi>Mater</hi> paſs from Pole to Pole; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Equinoctial. The Semicircles croſſing theſe <hi>Azimuths</hi> ſhall be <hi>Almicanters</hi> or Circles of Altitude. The Diameter croſſing the Axeltree of the <hi>Reet</hi> at Right Angles ſhall be the <hi>Horizon</hi> or <hi>Finiter,</hi> whoſe Graduations are ſet to him in a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der below the Center, and from him are the <hi>Almicanters</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned upward to the <hi>Zenith.</hi> The <hi>Azimuths</hi> may be reckoned from the North or South Semicircles of the Meridian, or from the Axtree line of the <hi>Reet,</hi> which is the Eaſt or Weſt <hi>Azimuth,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Prime Vertical.</hi> When I bid you ſet the Vertex of the <hi>Reet</hi> to the Latitude of your place, you muſt firſt know what your Latitude is. It is the neareſt diſtance of your place from the Terreſtrial Equinoctial, numbred in degrees and minutes of a great Circle. The Latitude of <hi>London</hi> is 31 degr. 32 min. North. The Latitude of <hi>Ecton</hi> or <hi>Northampton,</hi> is 52 degr. 15 minutes, or very near, And how to get the Latitude of thoſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101831:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>or any other place ſhall be ſhewed Book 4.11. The Latitude had, number the degrees thereof upon the <hi>Ring</hi> from C or <hi>Meridies</hi> (where the Equator cutteth the Meridian) toward A or <hi>Oriens,</hi> which in this Projection is the North Pole, becauſe we in England have North Latitude. At the end of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſee for <hi>London</hi> 51. degrees 32. minutes, from the Equator Northward, ſet the Vertex of the <hi>Reet,</hi> ſo this Vertex repreſenteth the Zenith, or point in the Heaven which is juſt over your head, in which point all the Azimuths meet, and through which alſo paſſeth the Meridian of your place, which here is repreſented by the outmoſt Circle of the <hi>Mater,</hi> or the innermoſt Circle of the <hi>Ring.</hi> Now is the upper Semicircle of your Meridian divided into four notable parts. From the Zenith Southward to the Equator is the Latitude 51. degrees 32 minutes, from thence to the Horizon is the complement of the Latitude 38. degrees 28. minutes, making up a Quadrant: againe from the Zenith Northerly to the Pole, is the complement of Latitude 38. degr. 28. minutes, as before: and from thence to the North of the Horizon is the Elevation of the Pole above your Horizon: which is always equall to the Latitude of your place: for where in a right <hi>Sphear</hi> the Polesly in the Horizon, and have on Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there the Equator paſſeth through the Zenith, and if you go from ſuch a Country Northward till the Pole be Elevated one degree, the Equator ſhall there decline from your Zenith one degree Southward, becauſe the Equator keeps always the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of 90 degrees from the Poles. And this diſtance of the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith of your place from the Equator is called by Geographers <hi>Latitude,</hi> and is always equal to the Elevation of your Pole. So that it is all one whether you ſet the Vertex 51. degrees 32. min. above the Equator, or ſet the North point of the Horizon 51. degrees 32. minutes below the North Pole.</p>
                  <p>Now the Vertex of the <hi>Reet</hi> ſet to the Latitude, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Pole mounted to his due Elevation, your <hi>Plani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphear</hi> is in a right mode and poſture ſpeedily to reſolve all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions concerning the Diurnall motion; as the Suns longitude, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, Right Aſcenſion, the Aſcenſionall differences, with the Semidiurnall Arch or length of the day, the Suns Altitude, Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth, and Amplitude; the hour and minute of the day, the beginnings endings and duration of twilight, and ſuch like; and that with ſo great facility, that having onely the Longitude of

               </head>
               <p>THe Equinoctial Projection repreſenteth the Northern or Southern Hemiſphear projected upon the plain of the Equator. Here the <hi>Limb</hi> or outmoſt Circles of the <hi>Mater</hi> and <hi>Reet</hi> are Equator. The eye-point
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101831:22"/>is the North or South Pole, which you will, by turns. Which Poles are here expreſſed on the Center of the Equator, becauſe the Sphear is pictured on a plain or flat. The Axtree line of the <hi>Mater</hi> A B is <hi>Colurus Equinoctiorum,</hi> the Diameter C D croſſing him is <hi>Colurus Solſtitiorum.</hi> But contrary on the <hi>Reet</hi> the Axletree is <hi>Colurus Solſtitiorum</hi> and the Finiter <hi>Colurus Equinoctiorum.</hi> The <hi>Colurus Solſtitiorum</hi> on the <hi>Mater</hi> is alſo the Meridian of your place, and therefore is marked with <hi>Septentrio,</hi> and <hi>Meridies;</hi> and the ends of the Axtree with <hi>Oriens,</hi> and <hi>Occidens.</hi> The reſt of the Meridians being all ſtraight lines meeting in the Poles or Center, are caſily ſupplyed by the <hi>Label:</hi> and ſo may the Parallels alſo, being Concentrick with the Equator. For if you lay the <hi>Label</hi> on the 15. degree in the <hi>Limb</hi> from <hi>Meridies</hi> toward <hi>Occidens,</hi> the fiduciall edge of the <hi>Label</hi> there deſigneth the 15 Meridian, or the One a clock line: the North Quadrant of the ſaid Meridian proceeding from the Center (now the North Pole) outward to the <hi>Limb</hi> or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial, and the South Quadrant returning in the ſame line from the Equinoctial to the <hi>Center:</hi> (now the South Pole:) and if you remove the <hi>Label</hi> 180 degrees from One a clock of the day there it ſhall deſigne One a clock at night, made by the other Semicircle of the ſame Meridian, which joyneth with his match in the Center without any angle, that is, into the ſame ſtraight line: and ſo of the reſt.</p>
               <p>And for the Parallels, if you ſet the point of your Compaſs or a needles point in the 23. degree ½ of the <hi>Label,</hi> and turn about the <hi>Label</hi> with the point, it ſhall deſcribe a Circle which will ſerve for both the Tropicks: and ſo may you make any other of the parallels. I do not adviſe you to draw the Meridians and Parallels in this form, leaſt you cumber your Inſtrument, but I ſhew you how you may repreſent any of them in a moment, when ocaſion requireth.</p>
               <p>The Meridians of the <hi>Mater,</hi> (that were ſo called in the Meridional Projection) are here turned into the ſeverall Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons of the World. And the Parallels here ſerve only to gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate thoſe Horizons. Out of theſe Horizons chooſe your own Horizon, and diſtinguiſh him if you will that you may readily find him when you ſhall looke for him.</p>
               <p>Your Horizon is thus inquired. Becauſe the Elevation of the Pole at <hi>Northampton</hi> is 52. degrees 15. minutes, therefore
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101831:23"/>from the Center (now North Pole) number in the Meridian line Northward 52. degrees 15. minutes, and there cutteth the the North Semicircle of our Horizon, or there you may Imagine him between the 52 and 53 Horizons, and the Southern Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle thereof lies 52 degrees 15 minutes on the other ſide the Center towards <hi>Meridies.</hi> This may ſeeme ſtrange that the North and South points of the Horizon, which in the <hi>Sphear</hi> are unequally diſtant from the North Pole, <hi>viz.</hi> the one but 51. degrees 15. minutes, and the other 127. degrees 45. minutes, (the ſupplement thereof) ſhould be equally diſtant in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. But the reaſon is becauſe the Center is both North and South Pole here at pleaſure, and the Northern and Southern <hi>Hemiſphears</hi> are both here repreſented by turns. Carry this in your head, and then lay the <hi>Eabel</hi> upon the South part of the Meridian, and number thereon from the Center (now North Pole) outward to the Equator at the <hi>Limb</hi> 90. degrees, thence number backward toward the Center (now the South Pole) the Elevation of the Equator (which is always complement of the Elevation of the Pole, and is here 37. degrees 45 minutes) there is the Southern point of the Horizon, and is diſtant from the Center (now South Pole) onely 52 degrees 15 minutes, but from the Center being North Pole 127. degrees 45. minutes, and from the Northern point of the Horizon before found juſt 180. degrees, as it is in the <hi>Sphear.</hi> Having found the North arch of your Horizon 52. degr. 15. min. behind the Center; count as many degrees and minutes forward in the Meridian before the Center toward <hi>Meridies,</hi> and the arch croſſing there ſhall be his match to make up the whole Circle; and ſo may you find your whole Horizon upon the <hi>Mater</hi> whatſoever your Latitude be.</p>
               <p>Here you muſt remember, that Stars which have Northern Declination riſe and ſet upon the Northern arch of the Horizon; and thoſe which have Southern declination upon the Southern arch. Remember alſo, that many Stars between the Tropicks which have Northern Latitude, have nevertheleſs Southern De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and contrary many which have Southern Latitude have Northern Declination.</p>
               <p>The lineaments of the <hi>Reet</hi> ſerving you in this Projection, are onely the Ecliptick, and the fixed Stars, the Almicanters and Azimuths here are of no uſe. The Meridians and Parallels
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101831:23"/>are ſupplyed by the <hi>Label,</hi> for the <hi>Reet</hi> as well as for the <hi>Mater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas the Ecliptick here ſeemes to be irregular, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Solſtitial</hi> points of <hi>Cancer</hi> and <hi>Caprcorn</hi> are not diſtant 180 degrees, as they ſhould be, you muſt imagine that the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern arch of the Ecliptick is Projected by the eye placed in the North Pole, and for the Northern arch the eyes place in the South Pole: and the Center ſerveth for both the Poles alike, as hath been ſhewed: number therefore as you were taught for the Horizon in this Projection. For the reaſon of the draught of the Horizon and of the Ecliptick in this Projection is the ſame.</p>

               <p>IN the Rectangular Spherical Triangle there be five parts one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come into the Queſtion; the three ſides, and two acute angles: becauſe the third (being right) is alwaies known. Of theſe five parts any two being given the reſt may be found.</p>

               <p>THis ſhould have been the third Probleme, conſidering what is given. But becauſe the way of reſolving this
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101831:27"/>caſe differeth from all the former, therefore I have reſerved it to the laſt place.</p>
               <p>In plain Triangles this caſe is inſoluble, But in Spherical Triangles it may be reſolved on the Planiſphear, two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt way hath M. <hi>Elagrave</hi> 5, 24. He ſets B C on the <hi>Limb</hi> between the Pole of the <hi>Mater</hi> and the Vertex of the <hi>Reet,</hi> B A and C A one on a Meridian, and the other on an <hi>Azimuth</hi> croſſing one another at a Right angle within the <hi>Limb.</hi> Which to do you muſt work thus. Example. In the former Triangle, the Angles are given A 90, B 23, degr. 30. min. C 77, degr. 43. min. Now firſt I will gueſs that the <hi>Hypotenuſa</hi> is 40 degrees, and ſetting the <hi>Zenith</hi> 40 degrees from the Pole, that arch of the <hi>Limb</hi> between <hi>Pole</hi> and <hi>Zenith</hi> I take for my <hi>Hypotenuſa,</hi> yet unknown. At the Pole ſhall be B, and at the <hi>Zenith</hi> C. Then becauſe B is 23 ½ I take the twentie-third Meridian from my <hi>Hypotenuſa</hi> which is on the <hi>Limb,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that and the 24th I imagin a Meridian which ſhall make B A of my Triangle. Alſo becauſe the Angle at C is 77, deg. 43. min. I take an imaginary <hi>Azimuth</hi> near the 78th, numbred from my <hi>Hypotenuſa</hi> which is on the <hi>Limb,</hi> and that <hi>Azimuth</hi> ſhall make C A of my Triangle. Now have I the Angles B and C, and three arches of which all the ſides of my Triangle ſhall be made: but whether B A and C A croſs at Right Angles I know not, and therefore I know not yet certainly the length of any ſide. Now to make the Angle at A a Right Angle, mark where your <hi>Azimuth</hi> (which you have taken for C A) cuts the Finiter, and from that point number in the Finiter toward the Center to 90 degrees, and there is the Pole of your <hi>Azimuth;</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> 12 degrees 17 minutes from the <hi>Limb</hi>) make a prick with ink at that Pole, and then look whether your Meridian 23 ½ (which you took for B A) cut this Pole, which yet he doth not as you will find. Therefore turn the <hi>Reet</hi> till the ſaid Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an do cut this Pole of the ſaid <hi>Azimuth,</hi> and then you may be ſure that Meridian and <hi>Azimuth,</hi> (wherever they croſs,) do make Right Angles. (By <hi>Pitiſc Trigonom.</hi> 1, 57) Therefore now have you all the Angles ſet on the Planiſphear, and thereby all the ſides found, <hi>viz.</hi> B C in the <hi>Limb</hi> 60, degr. B A in the Meridian 57 degrees 48 minutes C A in the <hi>Azimuth</hi> 20 degrees 12 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, as they ought to be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond way M. <hi>Oughtred</hi> uſeth: It is this. For the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101831:27"/>rectangled Triangle whoſe three Angles be given, you ſhall frame another oblique Triangle, whoſe ſides ſhall be equal to the Angles of the firſt Triangle. And ſo the Angles of the ſecond Triangle to be found on the Planiſphear ſhall be equal to the ſides of the firſt Triangle, which are inquired. The Triangle which ſerveth for an Example throughout this Book hath his Angles A 90 degrees C 77 degrees 43 minutes, B 23 degrees 30 minutes. Here to find the ſides, for the Angle A, I take half the Axis of the <hi>Mater</hi> from the Center to the Pole, and that ſhall be a ſide of 90 degrees. For the leſſer Angle B, I reckon upon the <hi>Label</hi> from the Center a ſide of 23 degrees 30 minutes, and at the end thereof make a prick, on the <hi>Label.</hi> I turn this prick upon the Parallel from the Pole 77 degrees 43 minutes, and the Meridian there Croſſing ſhall be the third ſide of this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle. Follow this Meridian to the Equator, and from his cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there to the Center is the meaſure of the leſſer Angle of this ſecond Triangle, which is equal to the leſſer Leg of the firſt Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle. 20 degr. 12 minutes: likewiſe the arch of the <hi>Limb</hi> from the Pole to the <hi>Label,</hi> is the meaſure of the middle Angle of the ſecond Triangle, which is equal to the middle ſide, that is, to the greater Leg of the firſt Triangle 57 degrees 48 minutes. And now having found the Legs of the firſt Rectangled Triangle you may by the firſt Probleme find the <hi>Hypotenuſa</hi> to be 60 degrees. The Rectangled Triangle uſed in the firſt way, and the oblique <hi>Quadrantal</hi> Triangle uſed in this ſecond way, ſhall appear in ſuch formes on the Planiſphear as theſe figures following do expreſs.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of the Solution of <hi>Oblique angled Spherical</hi> Triangles: And generally of all <hi>Spherical</hi> Triangles.</head>
               <p>THeſe ſix Chapters following might well have been pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before the ſecond Chapter. For howſoever they beſt ſerve Oblique angled Triangles, yet are the Rules general, and may ſerve very well for the ſolution of all <hi>Spherical</hi> Triangles whatſoever. But I like this order well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and I think the Reader will have no cauſe to diſlike it.</p>
               <p>There be twelve Caſes of Oblique-angled <hi>Spherical</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles. But for the <hi>Planiſphear</hi> they are here reduced to ſix. And they be all (unleſs I may except the laſt) as eaſily reſolved upon the <hi>Planiſphear</hi> as the five Caſes of Rectangled Triangles.</p>
               <p>Here note that for Oblique-angled Triangles, in all the Caſes following, one ſide ſhall evermore be ſet upon the <hi>Limb</hi> between one of the Poles of the <hi>Mater</hi> and the <hi>Zenith,</hi> of the <hi>Reet,</hi> and the other two ſides ſhall be made, one by a Meridian, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by an <hi>Azimuth;</hi> at the meeting whereof is the Angle C, which onely may remain unknown after any Queſtion reſolved, and may be preſently found by turning the Triangle, as before it hapned in the Rectangled Triangles.</p>
               <p>PROB. 1. <hi>Three</hi> Sides <hi>given, to find the</hi> Angles.</p>
               <p>SEt one Side, (which you will) upon the <hi>Limb</hi> between the Pole and <hi>Zenith,</hi> count the ſecond ſide from the Pole by the Parallels, and count the third ſide from the <hi>Zenith</hi> by the <hi>Almi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canters:</hi> and know that where the laſt Parallel cuts the laſt <hi>Almicanter,</hi> there is the point of the third Angle C: the Meridian that paſſeth from this point to the Pole is the ſide A C: the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimuth</hi> that paſſeth from the ſame point to the <hi>Zenith</hi> is the ſide B C: and the third ſide A B is on the <hi>Limb</hi> between the Pole and <hi>Zenith.</hi> Now may you count the Angles at the Pole and <hi>Zenith</hi> and B: and for the third Angle C, turn the Triangle laying one of the other ſides in the <hi>Limb</hi> between the Pole and <hi>Zenith,</hi> and you ſhall find that Angle alſo, as you did his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. Note that whereas I called the ſides of Rectangled Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101831:30"/>B A. C A, and B C, that is <hi>Baſis, Cathetus,</hi> and <hi>Hypotenuſa,</hi> I chooſe here in Oblique-angled Triangles, to tranſpoſe the letters of the two firſt ſides for diftinction ſake, calling them A B, and and A C, and the third ſide indifferently either B C or C B.</p>
               <p>Example. Let 40 degrees 70 degrees and 46 degrees ½ be Sides of a Triangle, whoſe Angles are ſought. Now becauſe I would firſt get the Angles joyning to the ſide 40 degrees. I mark that ſide A B, and ſet A B upon the <hi>Limb,</hi> A at he Pole, and B at the <hi>Zenith;</hi> which I remove 40 degrees from the Pole, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the length of the ſide A B. Then becauſe A C is 70 deg. I hold one finger (or a pin) upon the 70 Parallel from the Pole, and becauſe B C is 46 ½ I hold another finger on the 46 ½ <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micanter</hi> counted from the <hi>Zenith,</hi> and look where this <hi>Almi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantar</hi> croſſeth the ſaid 70 Parallel, there is C of my Triangle: The Meridian that comes from the Pole to C is the long ſide of my Triangle A C; I count then from the ſide A B on the <hi>Limb</hi> how many Meridians lie between A B and A C, and I find that A C is juſt the 45 Meridian, therefore I ſay the Angle A at the Pole is 45 degrees. The <hi>Azimuth</hi> that comes from the <hi>Zenth</hi> to C is here the middle ſide of my Triangle, being in length 46½ I count from the ſide A B of my Triangle on the <hi>Limb</hi> how many <hi>Azimuths</hi> there are to this and I find that this is the 114 <hi>Azimuth</hi> almoſt, therefore the Angle B at the <hi>Zenith</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt 114 degrees (exactly 113.30. minutes.)</p>
               <p>Now to find the Angle C, I turn the Triangle, and ſet B C, 46 degrees ½ on the <hi>Limb</hi> (changing the letters into A B) And where the 40 Parallel croſſeth the 70 <hi>Almicanter,</hi> there I meet with the 39 <hi>Azimuth,</hi> which ſhews me that the third Angle formerly called C, and now ſince the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle turned marked B is 39 degrees (exactly 38 deg 51 minutes.)</p>

               <p>Example. I have given A B 37 degrees 45 min. A C 105 degrees 41 minutes: and B 167 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees 09 minutes: I ſet the <hi>Zenith</hi> B 37 degrees 45 minutes from the Pole A, then becauſe B

Now becauſe A C his length is given (105 degrees 41 minutes, though the Angle A be yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known) I take the Parallel 105 degrees 41 minutes, numbred from the Pole A, and where this Parallel croſſeth the 167 <hi>Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth,</hi> there I am ſure muſt be the Angle C: and the Meridian paſſing from C to the Pole is the ſide A C 105 degrees 41 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes: this Meridian lieth between the 12 and 13 number from A B, and ſheweth the Angle A to be 12 degrees 26 minutes: the ſide B C, I may count 68 degrees ½ by help of the <hi>Almi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantars.</hi> Now have I three ſides and two Angles, which are more then enough to find the Angle C, when the Triangle is turned.</p>
               <p>Note that you may place the known Angle at the Pole as well as at the <hi>Zenith,</hi> and it may be needfull ſo to do when the Angle C of your Triangle would otherwiſe fall under the <hi>Limb</hi> of the <hi>Zodiaque.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note alſo that the Angle C may ſometime fall under the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niter, where the <hi>Azimuths</hi> faile. As if you had ſet the Angle 167 degrees at the Pole, the oppoſite ſide 105 degrees 41 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes had been ſet in an <hi>Azimuth,</hi> and C had been beyond the Finiter: your remedie in this caſe is to ſet <hi>Nadir</hi> in the place of <hi>Zenith,</hi> ſo ſhall C fall among the <hi>Azimuths</hi> juſt as you would have him. Example. Set 37 degrees 45 minutes between the Pole and <hi>Nadir (a b)</hi> count the Angle given at the Nadir <hi>b</hi> 167 degrees 9 minutes and his ſupplement 12 degrees 51 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, for A C count <hi>a C</hi> the ſupplement thereof, and you ſhall find <hi>b C</hi> 111 ½, whoſe ſupplement is B C 68 ½.</p>
               <p>Note thirdly, that if the angle given in this chapter be a cute, then if you place the known Angle at the <hi>Zenith,</hi> the Parallel may croſs the <hi>Azimuth</hi> twice; or if you place the known Angle at the Pole, the <hi>Almicanter</hi> taken to find out the oppoſite ſide, may croſs the Meridian twice; and ſo it may be doubtfull in which interſection the Angle C ſhall be found: That you may diſcover, if you examine which agrees beſt with the other parts of the Triangle being turned; or if you reduce this Triangle to

                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> How to reduce an Oblique angled Triangle to two Rect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angled Triangles, by letting fall a Perpendicular.</head>
               <p>BEcauſe the third Probleme of Oblique angled Triangles cannot be reſolved by the Canon of Sines and Tangents without letting fall a Perpendicular, and becauſe in that caſe the croſſing at the Angle C is oft ſo Oblique that you cannot define the Angular point certainly, and becauſe in the <hi>Method</hi> for reſolving the third Probleme one of the ſides of the Triangle hapneth ſome times to make two interſections with the Parallels or <hi>Almicanters,</hi> and there may be doubt which of theſe interſections is to be taken for the Angle C. Although I there ſhewed another way to reſolve that doubt, yet I will ſhew you alſo how to reſolve it, and to remedie the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces aforeſaid, by letting fall a Perpendicular. And it ſhall ſuffice to ſhew you this in one example, which if you mark and be acquainted with the four firſt Problemes of Rectangled Spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Triangles you ſhall be able to do it in any other needfull caſe whatſoever. Take therefore the Triangle of Chap 16. where we had given A B 37.45 minutes A C 105, 41. minutes. B 167. 9 min. you muſt obſerve that the Perpendicular ought to fall from the end of a known ſide, and to ſubtand ſome known An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, which here cannot be, becauſe both the Angles at the Baſe A C are unknown.</p>
               <p>Continue therefore the ſides A C and B C to Semicircles, and you ſhall have a ſecond Triangle N P C, in which, N P is equal to A B, N C is ſupplement of B C. P C ſuplement of A C: N ſupplement of B. C is common to both Triangles.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>In the Triangle P R N you have (beſide the Right Angle R) the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle N 12. 51 minutes, (ſupplement of B) and the <hi>Hypotenuſa</hi> N P 37. 45 minutes; and ſo may find all the reſt of this Triangle, by the third Probleme of Rect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular Spharical Triangles, <hi>viz.</hi> P R 7. 49 min. ½ N P R 79, 49 min. and R N 37 degrees, which had,</p>
               <p>In the Triangle P R C, by the ſecond Probleme of Rectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Spharical Triangles you may find R C 70 degrees (which added to R N maketh N C 111 ½, whoſe ſupplement is C B 68 ½) C 8 degr. ½, C P R 88 degr. which added to N P R maketh the whole Angle C P N 167, 47. which being ſubducted out of 180 degr. leaveth the ſupplement thereof C A B 12.13 min. as I find it by my Planiſphear; and by exact calculation it may be 12 26 minutes.</p>
               <p>Thus have you a perfect <hi>Method</hi> of reſolving all Spherical Triangles by the Planiſphear.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THe beſt method (in my judgement) for ſetting down the Problemes of the</hi> Sphear <hi>is, to ſet them in ſuch order, that the former may be</hi> Praecognita <hi>to the latter, and the latter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe the knowledge of the former. This moſt</hi> Authors <hi>have uſed. But this method here aimed at, perhaps is not alwaies kept exactly. Becauſe where one Triangle ſerves to reſolve di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> Problemes, <hi>I was willing to make an end with him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time before I meddled with another, for avoiding the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of</hi> Chapters, <hi>and repetition of the ſame</hi> Schemes.</p>
               <p>THere be in the Sphearfive famous Triangles, by the knowledge where of moſt <hi>Aſtronomical Problemes</hi> are reſolved, inſomuch that if you be but well verſed in the general <hi>Problemes</hi> of <hi>Trygonometry</hi> ſet down in the former Book, and have acquaintance with theſe five Triangles in the Sphear, you will be able to reſolve moſt of the following <hi>Problemes</hi> without any further help.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:101831:35"/>Of thoſe five Triangles three are Rectangled, which ſhall be here denominated from their <hi>Hypotenuſa's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Ecliptical Triangle, whoſe <hi>Hypotenuſa</hi> is an arch of the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> his Legs are arches of the <hi>Equator,</hi> and a Meridian: he ſerveth eſpecially for Queſtions of the Suns Longitude, Right Aſcenſion, and Declination, with ſome others, See this Ch. 6 &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Horizontal</hi> Triangle, whoſe ſides, are arches of the <hi>Horizon, Equator,</hi> and a <hi>Meridian.</hi> He ſerveth eſpecially for Queſtions of the Suns Amplitude, <hi>Aſcenſional</hi> difference, and Declination, and of the Latitude of your place. See this Chapter 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Azimuthal</hi> or <hi>Parrallactical</hi> Triangle, whoſe ſides are arches of an <hi>Azimuth,</hi> the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> and a Circle of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude: he ſerveth eſpecially to find the Moons <hi>Parallaxes</hi> in Altitude, Longitude, and Latitude. See this Chap. 64.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The other two are <hi>Oblique angled.</hi> One I uſe to call the <hi>Complemental</hi> Triangle, becauſe all his ſides be complements, <hi>viz.</hi> the Complement of Latitude, of Declination, and of Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. He ſerveth. cheifly to find the Altitude, <hi>Azimuth,</hi> and Hour. See this Chap. 24.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The laſt, I uſe to call the <hi>Polar</hi> Triangle, becauſe one ſide of him is evermore the diſtance of the Poles of the World, and of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> (23 degrees ½) his other ſides are a Meridian, and a Circle of Longitude. He ſerveth chiefly to find the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude and Latitude, the Right <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> and <hi>Declination</hi> of the Stars. See this Chap. 34.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe <hi>Planiſphear</hi> may here ſupply the office of a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant (which is the fitteſt and moſt common Inſtrument for taking Altitudes) For the <hi>Planiſphear</hi> is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 4 Quadrants, and if you hang a plumb-line at the Center, it may ſerve any of them. Set your Sights to one of the Semidiameters of the <hi>Mater,</hi> and turn him ſo to the Sun that the Sun may ſhine through the Sights; then ſhall the plumb-line (if
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101831:36"/>it hang Parrallel to the <hi>Planiſphear,</hi> neither bearing upon it, nor hanging off from it) ſhew in the loweſt Quadrant of the <hi>Limb</hi> the degrees of Altitude. But becauſe the Quadrants may be ſmal, I have ſhewed you a way how to make them ſerve your turn as well as if they were of double Semidiameter, Book 1.10. whither I refer you.</p>
               <p>My Sights for the Sun and Moon I have deviſed to make thus.</p>
               <p>Let them be about an inch ſquare for a <hi>Planiſphear</hi> of a foot Diameter: And in the middle of that ſight next you (which muſt be a thin plate) let a very ſmal hole be drilled quite through: in the middle of the Sight next the Sun, bore an hole as big as a Peaſe, or bigger, whoſe Center muſt anſwer the ſmal hole in the other Sight, then croſs the Center of the hole in the Sight next the Sun with an hair, or fine thrid, ſo that the thrid may run level or Parrallel with the <hi>Horizon,</hi> when you uſe the Sights. When you turn the Sights toward the Sun, and the ſhadow of the thrid fall, upon the ſmal hole of the lower Sight, you ſhall ſet or hold a white paper about a ſpan behind the lower Sight, upon which paper you ſhall perceive a ſmal Image of the Suns body, and likewiſe of the thrid cutting through the midſt of him very diſtinctly. And here you ſhall obſerve that the image of the thrid moveth upon the image of the Sun in the paper, contrary to the motion of the ſhadow of the thrid upon the lower Sight; for when the ſhadow of the thrid toucheth the bottom of the Sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole, the image of the thrid ſhall touch the top of the Suns image on the paper, and contrarily. But when the ſhadow of the thrid cutteth the middle of the Sight-hole, then ſhall the image of the thrid always cut the middle of the image of the Sun upon the paper exactly and clearly. Alſo you ſhall obſerve that though the Diameter of the Sun be always more then 30 min. yet the Diameter of the image cannot be obſerved here to be much above 20 min. as you may meaſure by the min. of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant which the plumb-line paſſeth over, while the image of the thrid paſſeth over the image of the Sun: whither the Diameter of the Suns image on the paper be diminiſhed by reaſon of the thickneſs of the plate through which the beams paſs, or becauſe the image on the paper is ſmal, the beginning and end of the Obſcuration by the image of the thrid, cannot be preciſely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, for the preſent, I leave to Optical men to enquire: Alſo what is the reaſon why the image of the thrid moveth contrary
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101831:36"/>to the motion of his ſhadow, is a queſtion of ſome difficulty: My reſolution is, becauſe that image is a ſpecies which paſſeth through the Sight-hole with the ſpecies of the Suns body: For when the ſhadow of the thrid falleth upon the lower part of the Sight-hole, then certainly the upper part of the Suns body is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the obſcuration of the thrid, and the lower edge is Eclipſed at the Sight-hole. Now the wayes of the Suns body thus Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on the lower ſide, paſſing through the Sight-hole, muſt needs be there decuſſated, ſo that the wayes or beames comming from the lower part of the Sun ſhall make the higher part of the image on the paper, and contrarily; as appeareth when an Eclipſe of the Sun is obſerved by a <hi>Teleſcope,</hi> or by a ſmal hole, letting the beames into a dark room: For the reaſon here and there is the ſame. I have uſed thoſe Sights for the Sun and Moon almoſt theſe 20 years paſt, and (for ought I could ever read or hear) they are of my own invention, and I have not met with any device more commodious to me for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>For the Moon, you muſt ſet your eye to the loweſt Sight-hole, and let the thrid cut the middle of her body. For the Stars, if your eye cannot diſcern them by the thrid, you muſt behold them by the edges of the Sights both above and below. Or if you would obſerve the Stars Altitude by ſome larger Inſtrument, I adviſe that the Sight next your eye be a broad plate 4 or 5 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſquare, in the middle whereof you ſhall cut a window whoſe length may be near 2 inches, and his breadth or height about an inch or more, ſo that your eye may be well ſhadowed, and yet have free ſcope through the window to find the Star. Let the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sight be a Cylinder or ruler ſet Parrallel to the lower Sight, and his breadth be equal to the window almoſt, but narrower by a few minutes as 2 min. or 4 min. when you looking through this window can ſee the Star appear alike on both ſides, the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sight, then is your Inſtrument right ſet, and the plumb-line ſhall ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w you his Altitude as before. Note that for all curious obſervation of the Sun or Stars, your Inſtrument muſt be ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a Tripos, or like device, that it may be ſteddy, and that the apparent Altitudes of the Sun and Moon muſt be corrected according to the Table of Parrallax and Refraction. The ſixed Stars have Refraction, but no Parrallax ſenſible. The quantity of the Parrallax is to be added, and the quantity of the Refraction to be ſubtracted alwayes from the apparent Altitude found, ſo ſhall you have the true Altitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:101831:37"/>Here followeth an Abridgement of <hi>Lanſbergius Tables</hi> of Refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Parrallax of the Sun, as much as this Inſtrument may need, for the reſt go to <hi>Lanſbergius</hi> or <hi>Tycho Brahe's</hi> Tables at large, where you ſhall find the Moons Parrallax in the Horizon, to be ſometimes 51 minutes, ſometimes 1 deg. 7 min. at 70 degrees of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, between 18 deg. 24 min. Here Refraction is as the Sun.</p>

Then take the Suns Altitude: the Altitude would be taken at leaſt 2 hours (the more the better) before noon: and note, that if you take it between 29 and 30 degrees you ſhall be troubled nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Parrallax nor Refraction, becauſe the Suns Refract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>n and Parrallax be equall at the Altitude 29 degrees 26 minutes. The Altitude taken, you ſhall immediately lay your <hi>Planiſphear</hi> in the poſture aforeſaid; and turning the <hi>Label</hi> to the Sun, make a prick in the <hi>Limb</hi> where the <hi>Label</hi> cutteth: And when the Sun comes to the ſame Altitude after-noon, your <hi>Planiſphear</hi> laid as before, turn your <hi>Label</hi> to the Sun, and where he cuts make a ſecond prick in the <hi>Limb.</hi> Then divide equally the Arch of the <hi>Limb</hi> comprehended between the pricks: and to the middle thereof lay the <hi>Label,</hi> and it ſhall point full North and South. Look then through your Sights; and if you ſee any Steeple, Pinacles. Chimney, Tree, or ſuch mark, at a good diſtance in the line of Viſion, you may note him for a South-mark, or for want thereof ſet up a ſmaller mark neerer hand. But note alſo that this may beſt be done when the Sun is in or neer the Summer <hi>Tropick,</hi> for neer the <hi>Equator</hi> he changeth his Declination ſo faſt, that it may cauſe you an error of a few minutes, unleſs you make allowance for it.</p>

                  <hi>2.</hi> Another way.</p>
               <p>Having taken the Altitude of the Sun, or a Star, at a good diſtance from the Meridian; preſently lay your <hi>Plani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphear</hi> flat, and turn the <hi>Label</hi> to the Sun, or Star, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Then by the Altitude taken, get the <hi>Azimuth;</hi> (by chap. 24 or 27 of this book.) Then remove your <hi>Labet</hi> (Eaſtward; if the Sun or Star were Weſtward from the Meridian; or Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward if the Sun or Star be in the Eaſt Hemiſphear;) ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees as the <hi>Azimuth</hi> cometh to, and your <hi>Label</hi> ſhall be in the Meridian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3.</hi> A third way.</p>
               <p>When the great <hi>Wain</hi> is ſeen under <hi>Cynoſura,</hi> (the Pole Star) obſerve with your eye the diſtance of the <hi>Thill-horſe,</hi> called <hi>Alioth,</hi> from the next wheel of the <hi>Wain</hi> and ſetting that diſtance (by aime) in 5 parts, obſerve by a plumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line when <hi>Alioth</hi> drawes neer to be in the ſame Perpendicular with the Pole Star. For when he wanteth but one of thoſe 5 parts to come into the <hi>Perpendicular,</hi> then is the <hi>Pole-ſtar</hi> in the Meridian over the <hi>Pole</hi> in our age: at other times of the night the <hi>Pole-ſtar</hi> may be 4 degrees wide, and in one hour neer the Meridian he changeth his <hi>Azimuth</hi> above one degree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4.</hi> A fourth way.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the diſtance of the <hi>Pole-ſtar</hi> from the <hi>Pole</hi> is now 2 degrees 30 minutes, and the <hi>Pole</hi> is in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle or line which paſſeth from the <hi>Pole-ſtar</hi> neer <hi>Alioth,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; you may by gueſs cut off from that line 2 degrees 30 min. and in that Section you have the <hi>Pole</hi> at any time. This way may be uſed abroad in the fields, where you cannot ſtand upon exactneſs; and herein you ſhall miſs very little, if you accuſtome your ſelf to obſerve the diſtances of the Stars about the <hi>Pole.</hi>

               <p>THe Longitude of the Sun is the arch of his diſtance from ♈ 0 in the <hi>Ecliptick:</hi> or it is the angle made at the Pole of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> comprehended between the circle of Longitude paſſing through ♈ 0, and another Circle of Longitude paſſing through the center of the Sun: for the ſaid arch of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> is always the proper meaſure of this Angle. And becauſe the Suns center never hath Latitude, therefore for the Sun you ſhall enquire the arch; but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, for the Stars which have Latitude, you ſhall require the Angle: and they be both (as was ſaid) of one meaſure.</p>
               <p>The Suns Longitude (Arch or Angle) is preſently found by the <hi>Ephemeris</hi> upon the <hi>Limb</hi> of your <hi>Planiſphear,</hi> for if you lay the <hi>Label</hi> upon the day of the Moneth, it ſhall cut the degree of the Signe alſo in which the Sun is, and that is his Longitude: in doing whereof, you ſhall obſerve the cautions given Lib. 1.8. to which I refer you.</p>

               <p>The Right Aſcenſion of the Sun is the angle at the Pole of the World comprehended between that Side of the <hi>Colurus Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiorum</hi> which cuts the interſection of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> with the <hi>Equator</hi> in ♈ 0, and the arch of another Meridian which paſſeth through the center of the Sun. And note, that this angle may increaſe above 180 degrees, even to 360 degrees, though every angle, properly ſo called be leſs then 180 degrees, and never more then 90 degrees comes into the Triangle: for if you num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber backwards or forwards from either of the Equinoctiall points, you ſhall have like arches of Right Aſcenſion anſwering to like arhces of Longitude and Declination; ſo that having found the Right Aſcenſion in any one Quadrant, or the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therof, you ſhall find the whole Right Aſcenſion from ♈ 0 by adding one, two, or three whole Quadrants to the Right Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion found, or to the complement therof, as by the view of your Planiſphear you ſhall preſently know how to do better then by more words. Otherwiſe thus. The Right Aſcenſion of the Sun is an arch of the Equator comprehended between the <hi>Vernal Equinox</hi> and that point of the Equator which riſeth with the Sun in a right Horizon. A right Horizon is where the Equator paſſeth through the <hi>Zenith,</hi> and maketh right angles with the Horizon, and conſequently, where the Poles have no Elevation: For from that poſture of the Sphear in which the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101831:39"/>Equator riſeth upright, is the term of Right Aſcenſion borrowed: I would, if I might, call it rather Equation; becauſe it is numbred on the Equator, and ſerves for the Equation of naturall days, and may as eaſily be found in any Sphear as in a right Sphear, ſince the Horizon of a right Sphear limits the Right Aſcenſion only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Horizon falls in with a Meridian, and the Meridians do limit it in all parts and poſtures of the Equator, without any reſpect to the Horizon at all. But the old term hath ſo long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured, that I beleeve it will not be changed without better Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>Theſe definitions premiſed, you ſhall know that theſe three arches, <hi>viz.</hi> of Longitude in the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> of Right Aſcenſion in the Equator, and of Declination in a Meridian, do make up a notable Rectangled-Triangle in the Sphear,<note place="margin">The Ecliptical Triangle.</note> like unto that which was made the common Example, in all the five Problemes of Rectangled-Triangles. Book 3, 3. &amp;c.</p>

               <p>But to ſee your Triangle, and reſolve him in his proper lines, Go to the <hi>Mater</hi> of your Planiſphear, and take him there in the firſt Projection. There number 60 the Suns Longitude in the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> line of the <hi>Mater</hi> from the Center outward. Where 60 endeth, there is C of your Triangle, and the Meridian that meets you there is C A the arch of Declination; follow him to the Equator, and you ſhall find by his graduation he is 20 degr. 12 min. Long. thence turn in the Equator to the Center, and you make B A the Right Aſcenſion 57 degr. 48 min. ſo have you
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101831:39"/>the true picture of your Triangle in his proper place. Obſerve your Triangle now, and you may ſee A is a right angle, for at ſuch angle all the Meridians cut the Equator. B is 23 ½, for ſuch an angle the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> dayly maketh with the Equator, as the arch in the <hi>Limb</hi> comprehended between them ſhewes. Now take for given any of the three Sides, and you have the reſt. Take the Longitude for given (and be it 60 degr. as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or 70 degr. or what you will) and you may find the Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and Right Aſcenſion as before. Let the Right Aſcenſion be given; then ſetting a needles point in the end thereof A, you may thence in a Meridian trace out the Declination C A to the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> and the Longitude B C thence to the Center, every Side being divided into his whole parts or degrees. If the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination be given, ſay, Becauſe the 20th Parrallel almoſt muſt cut off C A (the arch of Declination) in C, therefore I follow the Parallel 20 ⅕ to the place where he cutteth the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> and there comes the Meridian that ſerves my turn; and I may go down by him to the Equator, (as you would go down a ladder counting the rounds or degrees as you go) and ſo on, round my Triangle, and I need no more. For obſerve it when you will in the uſe of this Planiſphear, if you can find the way to go round your Triangle, you have all the Sides meaſured to your hand, and evermore one Angle alſo, moſt commonly two, and the angle C onely left unknown.</p>
               <p>But admit the Sun be in ♌ 0, then is his Longitude 120, degrees, and he is come back from the <hi>Solſtice</hi> in your Planiſphear as many degr. as he wanted of it before. Here the Triangle is equal to the former, and reſolved in like manner. The Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is the ſame as before: But the arches of Longitude and Right Aſcenſion in the Triangle are ſupplements of the true Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude and Right Aſcenſion; ſhewing what the Sun wants of the Longitude and Right Aſcenſion 180, in ♎ 0. wherefore ſubtract the Baſe of the Triangle 57 degr. 48 min. from a Semicircle, or 180 degr. and you ſhall leave 122 degr. 12 min. the Right Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of ♌ 0. or number in the Equator from the Center the way in which the Right Aſcenſion hath increaſed, that is firſt to the <hi>Limb</hi> (which here is <hi>Colurus Solſtitiorum</hi>) 90 degr. then back again to A the Right angle of your Triangle, and you have 32 degr. 12 min. to be added thereto. The Sum is 122 degr. 12 min. the Right Aſcenſion, as before: If you obſerve this Example,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101831:40"/>you will eaſily perceive, that when the Sun is paſt ♎ 0. the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle will be on the other ſide the Center, and between ♎ and ♑ you muſt add to the Right Aſcenſion and Longitude found within the Triangle 180 degr. and in the laſt Quadrant between ♑ and ♈ (where the Right Aſcenſion again increaſeth inwards) you muſt add 270 degr. to the complement of Right Aſcenſion found in the Triangle, and take the ſum, or elſe ſubduct the Right Aſcenſion found in the Triangle from 360 degr. and take the reſidue for the Right Aſcenſion.</p>

               <p>IN the Meridional Projection do thus.</p>
               <p>If you have the Longitude given, count the diſtance of the Sun in that Longitude from the next Equinoctial point, and count ſo many degrees in the <hi>Arctick</hi> Circle from the <hi>Limb</hi> inwards: to the end of this numbring, lay the <hi>Label,</hi> and between the <hi>Label</hi> and Equator you have upon the <hi>Limb</hi> the leſſer angle made between the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> and Meridian; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er angle is the ſupplement thereof. Alſo between the <hi>Arctick</hi> Circle and the <hi>Limb</hi> you may find the Declination on the <hi>Label,</hi> which is more then was required.</p>
               <p>If you have the Declination given, count it on the <hi>Label</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and make a prick where the number ends, then turn this prick upon the <hi>Arctick</hi> Circle, and the <hi>Label</hi> ſheweth the leſſer angle in the <hi>Limb,</hi> as before.</p>
               <p>Example. I would know what angle the Meridian that cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Sun in ♉ 9 degr. maketh with the <hi>Ecliptick.</hi> I number therefore in the <hi>Arctick</hi> Circle from the <hi>Limb</hi> inwards 39 deg. and to the 39th degr. I ſay the <hi>Label,</hi> and it ſheweth in the <hi>Limb</hi> the angle ſought 71 degr. 20 min. and in the <hi>Label</hi> the Declination of ♉ 9 degr. <hi>viz.</hi> 14. 32 minutes: this is a good way. But that the <hi>Label</hi> at this 39th degr. cutteth the Pole of the Ecliptick (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Blagrave</hi> ſaith Book 3, 40.) is not true: either M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Blagrave</hi> or the Printer here miſtakes. For the Pole of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> lies 14. 24 minutes nearer the Axletree, as you ſhall find in the next rule.</p>

               <p>GEographers call the diſtance of a place from the neareſt point of the Equator upon Earth, the <hi>Latitude of that Place,</hi> as the Latitude of London is 51 deg. 32 min. from the Equator Northward: the Latitude of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Iſland</hi> upon the coaſt of <hi>Africk</hi> is 0 deg. 0 min. becauſe the middle of that Iſland lyeth under the Equator. And becauſe the Latitude of your Place, and the Elevation of the Pole above your Horizon, are alwaies equal, therefore the Elevation of the Pole is oft called <hi>Latitude of the Place,</hi> or <hi>Latitude</hi> ſimply: and ſo for brevity ſake we ſhall often call it. But when we ſpeak of the Latitude of the Moon or Stars, you muſt underſtand Aſtronomers thereby mean their diſtance from the neereſt point of the Ecliptick.</p>
               <p>To find the Latitude of your Place, get the Suns Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, by the 6 or 7th. and his Meridian Altitude by the ſecond of this Book: Then find the parallel of the Suns Declination, North or South as the Declination is, and where it toucheth the <hi>Limb</hi> (here Meridian) there is the point where you obſerved the Sun at Noon; ſet the South end of the Finiter ſo many degr. below this point as the Meridian Altitude had, then is your Finiter ſet to your Latitude, and you ſhall find the meaſure of it between the Equator and the <hi>Zenith,</hi> (which is properly the Latitude) and the ſame meaſure ſhall you find between the North point of the Finiter and the North Pole, where it is more properly called the <hi>Elevation of the Pole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Example. <hi>June</hi> 20 1651. I obſerved the Meridian Altitude of the Sun, here at <hi>Ecton,</hi> four miles Eaſtward from <hi>Northampton,</hi> 60 degr. 59 min. the Longitude of the Sun was then ♋ 8 degr. 19 min. ½, his Declination 23 degr 14 min.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101831:42"/>having found in the <hi>Limb</hi> the point where the Parallel 23 degr. 14 min. toucheth above the Equator, I put the South end of the Finiter 60 degr. 59 min. below that point, toward the South Pole, which done, I ſee the North Pole Elevated above the Finiter 52 degr. 15 min. and the <hi>Zenith</hi> of my Horizon like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be removed from the Equator Northward 52 degr. 15 min. which is the Latitude of <hi>Ecton.</hi>

               <p>Obſerve both the Meridian Altitudes, and add them together, half that ſum is the Elevation of the Pole. Example. I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Ecton</hi> the greateſt Altitude of the Pole-ſtar to be 54 deg. 45 min. and his leaſt Altitude 49 degr. 45 min. the ſum is 104 deg. 30 min. the half 52 degr. 15 min. the Latitude of <hi>Ecton:</hi> and here I have gotten alſo the Pole-ſtars diſtance from the Pole, and conſequently his Declination which is the complement thereof, for the Latitude being ſubducted from the greater Altitude leaves the Stars diſtance from the Pole 2 degr. 30 min. and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſhewes his Declination to be 87 degr. 30 min. which is 39 min. more then <hi>Gemma Friſius</hi> obſerved it, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1547. for in our age the Pole-ſtar approcheth about 1 min. nearer the Pole in every 3 years.</p>

               <p>THe Oblique Aſcenſion is the arch of the Equator which riſeth with the Sun or any Star in an Oblique Sphear, that is, a Sphear wherein the Equator maketh an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Angle with the Horizon. This arch beginneth alwayes from the Vernal Equinox, but we ſeek the latter term or end thereof. To find this by Calculation, we uſe to find firſt the Aſcenſional difference, that is the difference of the Right and Oblique Aſcenſion, or the arch of the Equator comprehended between the latter termes of the arches of the Right Aſcenſion and Oblique Aſcenſion of the Star, this difference for North Stars, we ſubtract from the Right Aſcenſion, and the remainder is the Oblique Aſcenſion; but for South Stars we add it to the Right Aſcenſion to make the Oblique Aſcenſion: and for Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Deſcenſion or Setting, contrarily, we add the Aſcenſional difference for North Stars, and ſubtract it for South: you ſhall ſee all plain in the Meridional Projection of the Planiſphear, and the firſt Mode thereof, where the Finiter is ſet to the Latitude.</p>
               <p>Example. I would know the Oblique Aſcenſion of the Sun in ♋ 0 and the Aſcenſional difference, The Declination of the Sun in ♋ 0 is 23 degr. 30 min. our Latitude 52 degr. 15 min. I go to the North Parallel 23 degr. ½, which is the <hi>Tropick</hi> of Cancer, on the <hi>Mater,</hi> and following him to the Finiter, there I turn in the Meridian which cutteth there, and go down to the Equator under the Horizon, and make a prick here; I ſay, is the Right Aſcenſion of the Sun in Cancer 0, for the ſame Meridian cutteth both theſe, and therefore both theſe points would riſe at once in a Right Sphear, where the Meridians by turns ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, become Horizon: but counting how many degrees are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this prick and the riſing point of the Equator, I find 34 degr. 10 min. this is the arch of Aſcenſional difference, which being ſubtracted out of the Right Aſcenſion of ♋ 0 (which by Chap. 6 is 90 degr.) there remaineth the Oblique Aſcenſion 55
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101831:43"/>degr. 50 min. And the meaning is, that whereas the Sun being in ♋ 0 in a Right Sphear, riſeth with the 90th degree of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator, in our Latitude, he riſeth with the 55 degr. 50 min. of the Equator: the difference of theſe Aſcenſions is 34 degr. 10 min. add this difference to the Right Aſcenſion of ♋ 0, and it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth 124 degr. 10 min. the Oblique Deſcenſion, for the 124th degree of the Equator ſetteth with ♋ 0, and the point of the Suns Right Aſcenſion ſhall in North Signes Set before him as much as it Riſeth after him, and in South Signes ſhall Set after him, as much as it Riſeth before him.

                  <item>2. Or if the Declination and Aſcenſional difference be given, number the Aſcenſional difference from the Center downwards in the Equator: Then go up in a Meridian as many degrees as the Declination comes to, and to the point where you end (which is C) ſet the Finiter, ſo he is placed to your Latitude, and the Amplitude alſo is ſhewn.</item>

                  <item>4. If the Latitude and Aſcenſional difference be given, the Finiter being ſet to the Latitude, count from the Center in the Equator to the end of the Aſcenſional difference, there is A: Go up thence in a Meridian to the Finiter; there is C: Go thence in the Finiter to the Center: there is B.</item>
                  <item>5. If the Latitude and Amplitude be given, the Finiter being ſet to the Latitude, count from the Center (B) in the Finiter to the end of the Amplitude (where ſhall be C) go down thence in a Meridian to the Equator, (where is A) thence in the Equator return to the Center B.</item>
                  <item>6. If the Amplitude and Aſcenſional difference be given, prick the end of the Amplitude numbred in the Finiter from the Center, and prick the end of the Aſcenſional difference, numbred in the Equator from the Center: then turn about the <hi>Reet</hi> till ſome one of the Meridians cut both theſe pricks, and that ſhall make up the Triangle.</item>

               <p>SEt the Finiter to the Latitude, (as-in the firſt Mode of the Meridional Projection.) Then ſeek the Parallel of the Declination of the Sun or Star, North, or South, as it hapneth to be. That Parallel ſhall be divided by the Finiter into two arches: the arch above the Finiter is the <hi>Semi-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal</hi> arch, in which you may count the time of Riſing and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and the Length of the Day: that below is the <hi>Semi-noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> arch, in which you may reckon the length of the Night; or if your Queſtion be of a Star, the time he ſpends under the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon.</p>
               <p>Example. In the firſt Scheme of the 14th Chapter, D E is the <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Cancer,</hi> that is the 23 ½ Parallel of North Declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: C E is the <hi>Semi-diurnal</hi> arch: C D the <hi>Semi-nocturnal.</hi> And you ſhall find in the Meridional Projection of your Planiſphear thoſe arches are divided by the Meridians; and the arch C E containeth 124 degr. 10 min. which turned into houres and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, (accounting every degree 4 minutes of Time, and every 15 degrees an houre,) is 8 houres 16 min. 40 ſec. half the length of our longeſt Day, and the arch C D containeth 55. deg. 50 min. that is, three houres 43 min. 20 ſec. half the length of our ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:101831:46"/>Night: therefore at three hours 43 min. after midnight the Sun Riſeth in the <hi>Tropick,</hi> and ſets ſo much before midnight, that is, at eight hours 16 min. 40 ſec. and ſo may you find your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in any other Parallel.</p>
               <p>Example. 2. I obſerve that <hi>Fomahant</hi> his Meridian Altitude is but 6.30 min. therefore by Chap. 13 he declineth South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward 31¼. I would know how long he ſhines with us; and I preſently ſee in the Meridional Projection of my Planiſphear, that his Parallel hath but 38 degr. above the Horizon; that is, he will ſet two hours 32 min. after he is South; and the whole time he ſhines in our Horizon, is five hours four minutes.</p>
               <p>Example. 3. <hi>Lyra</hi> her Declination is 38.30 min. North; and I ſee his Parallel comes within 45 min. of the Horizon, in the North part of the Meridian, but never toucheth it: therefore I conclude that <hi>Lyra</hi> never ſets with us at all.</p>

               <p>SEt the Planiſphear in the firſt Mode of the Meridional Projection; then turn the Planiſphear that the <hi>Zenich</hi> may be downwards, and the <hi>Almicanters</hi> moſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Horizon. Then go to the 18th <hi>Almicanter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Horizon: and whereſoever the Parallel of the Suns Declination doth cut that <hi>Almicanter,</hi> there is the beginning and end of Twilight: and becauſe every Parallel is divided by the Meridians into 12 hours, or 180 degr. (every 15 degr. being one hour) therefore you may eaſily count how far the point where Twilight begins, is diſtant from Midnight, or from Noon, or from Sun-riſe, or Sun-ſet in the Horizon.</p>
               <p>Example. In our Latitude 52 degr. 15 min. my Planiſphear ſet as aforeſaid, I find that where the 18th <hi>Almicanter</hi> cutteth the Equator under the Horizon, there cutteth alſo in the ſame interſection the 30th Meridian, or ſecond Hour Circle from the Axis and Center; by which I gather, that when the Sun is in the Equator, the twilight begins two hours before 6 or Sun-riſing, and ends likewiſe at 8 of the clock at Night, the Sun then ſetting, (as you may ſee) at 6. Likewiſe where the Winter <hi>Tropick</hi> cuts the 18th <hi>Almicanter,</hi> there cuts alſo the firſt Meridian from the Axis South-ward; ſhewing that in the depth of Winter Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light begins 4 minutes after 6 in the morning, and laſteth till 5 hours 56 minutes after-noon. Likewiſe I ſee that about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of ♊ where the Sun declineth North-wards about 20 degrees, the Twilight laſts till mid-night, and that from that time till the Sun comes to ♌ (that is, from <hi>May</hi> 11 to <hi>July</hi> 11, or thereabouts,) we have no dark night at all, unleſs the Skie be Cloudy, for in all that time the Sun is never found above 18 degrees under the Horizon.</p>

               <p>AStar is ſaid to riſe <hi>Coſmically</hi> when he riſeth at the ſame inſtant with the Sun.</p>
               <p>To find it, uſe the Equinoctial Projection: Turn the Star (being found in your <hi>Reet</hi>) to the Eaſt part of your Horizon, and look what degree of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> cutteth the ſame Eaſt part of your Horizon; for when the Sun comes to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the Star and Sun ſhall riſe both together. If the Star be not in your <hi>Reet,</hi> put him in with ink, as you put in the reſt, Book 1.7. if his place light upon a window, or hole of the <hi>Reet,</hi> prick him on the edge of the <hi>Label,</hi> and hold <hi>Reet</hi> and <hi>Label</hi> cloſe together, while you turn him to the Horizon.</p>
               <p>Example. <hi>Sirius</hi> I have among 40 other principal Stars in my <hi>Reet,</hi> and would adviſe you not to be without him, for he is a little Sun in a Winters Night, to tell you how the time paſſeth; he is called by the <hi>Latines</hi> both <hi>Canis,</hi> and <hi>Canicula;</hi> for they had no name for the little <hi>Dog,</hi> but called him by the Greek name <hi>Procyon,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> witneſſeth <hi>Lib.</hi> 18 <hi>Chap.</hi> 28: yet I have ſeen a late Writer, who takes upon him to teach the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of <hi>Phyſitians</hi> both <hi>Phyſick</hi> and <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> before he hath well learned either of them: who in his Obtrectations upon the <hi>Pharmacopaea Lond.</hi> in the Chapter of <hi>Vinum Scilliticum Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> betrayes his ignorance herein, as elſwhere in 100 other things, which I could ſhew; for in that very Chapter pag. 147 of his fourth Impreſſion, in 24 ſhort lines he commits 5 abſurd errors. 1. He makes it doubtfull whether <hi>Canis</hi> be to be taken for <hi>Sirius,</hi> or <hi>Procyon.</hi> 2. He goeth about to teach <hi>Galen</hi> where <hi>Squills</hi> grow; and that there is no hilly ground near the Sea. 3. He ſuppoſeth that the <hi>Acronycal</hi> riſing of the <hi>Dog</hi> (which hapneth in the depth of Winter) is a fitter time to gather <hi>Squils,</hi> then the <hi>Heliacal</hi> riſing, which hapneth near unto the <hi>Coſmical,</hi> in the heat of Summer. 4. He either ſuppoſeth that <hi>Squils</hi> grow in the Parallel of <hi>London,</hi> or that by the riſing of the <hi>Dog</hi> at <hi>London</hi> men ſhould gather <hi>Squils</hi> in <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:101831:47"/>5. He tells the <hi>Colledge</hi> that both the <hi>Dogs</hi> are between the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator and the South Pole, which indeed is newes, if it were true. Let the ingenuous Reader pardon this digreſſion, and I proceed.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Sirius</hi> I brought to our Horizon, (the 52 ¼) and found that there riſeth with him in the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> ♌ 18 ½. in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with <hi>Procyon</hi> riſeth ♌ 6 ⅓: therefore <hi>Sirius</hi> riſeth <hi>Coſmically</hi> with us <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1: and <hi>Procyon</hi> 12 dayes ſooner. But in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> in the Latitude 38 degr. <hi>Sirius</hi> riſeth with ♌ 4 ½, that is a fortnight ſooner.</p>
               <p>A Star is ſaid to Set <hi>Coſmically,</hi> when the Sun riſeth at his ſetting. Place the Star therefore on the Weſt part of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon: then look what degree of the <hi>Ecliptique</hi> riſeth in the Eaſt part; for when the Sun comes to that degree, the Star ſhall ſet <hi>Coſmically.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Example. I brought <hi>Sirius</hi> to the South-weſt part of our Horizon, where he uſeth to ſet. And in the South-eaſt part I ſaw ♏ 23 degrees in the <hi>Ecliptique</hi> riſing: therefore when the Sun is in ♏ 23.

For this no exact rule can be given, for all men have not like quickneſs of ſight, nor all Stars like brightneſs, nor all Climates, Countries and Dayes of the Year the ſame clearneſs of Air. And the Moon oft times aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth

The riſing and ſetting of the fixed Stars keep the ſame diſtance Yearly, from the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Solſtitiall points, for a mans age near enough; but longer thoſe rules cannot laſt without ſome perceivable error: for in 100. years the Stars go forward in Longitude. according to <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho.</hi> 1 degree 25 minutes, by reaſon whereof the riſings and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Stars happen later in the Year, about a day and half every 100 years in the ſame Latitude.</p>
               <p>Now if you would note in what Age a Star had ſuch a riſing or ſetting, in ſuch a Latitude, as for Example. In what age <hi>Arcturus</hi> roſe 60 dayes after mid-winter in the Latitude of <hi>Aſera</hi> in <hi>Boeotia</hi> near <hi>Athens,</hi> whoſe Latitude is 37 ¼, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently how long ſince <hi>Heſiod</hi> lived, in whoſe dayes <hi>Arcturus</hi> had ſuch riſing, you ſhall reaſon thus: 60. dayes after the Winter <hi>Tropick</hi> the Sun is in ♓ 1 degree by the <hi>Epheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> for in thoſe 60 dayes near his <hi>Perigium</hi> he goeth about 61 degrees. I am therefore to ſeek when <hi>Arcturus</hi> did riſe at <hi>Athens</hi> with the oppoſite degree of the <hi>Ecliptique,</hi> ♍ 1 degree (the Sun is in ♓ 1 degree, then ſetting over againſt it.) I ſeek the Longitude and Latitude of <hi>Arcturus,</hi> and find in <hi>Tycho'es</hi> Tables that <hi>Anno Domi.</hi> 1600. <hi>Arcturus</hi> had Longitude ♎ 18. 39 minutes, Latitude B. 31.02. minutes: then I will ſuppoſe that <hi>Heſiod</hi> lived 830. years before Chriſt (for there ſome <hi>Chronologers</hi> place him, but without any good proof that I find) that is, 2430 years before <hi>Anno Domi.</hi> 1600. in which ſpace of time <hi>Arcturus</hi> muſt have increaſed his Longitude by <hi>Tycho' Hypotheſis</hi> 34 degrees 25 minutes, which being ſubducted out of the Longitude which <hi>Arcturus</hi> had <hi>Anno Domi.</hi> 1600. leaves his Longitude for the year before Chriſt 830. ♍ 14. degree 14. minutes, his Latitude was then and ever 31.02 minutes. Now from this Longitude and Latitude, I get his Right Aſcenſion, and Declination, by Chap. 34. of this Book, where I find Aſcenſion 180. degrees, Declination North 34. degrees 15 minutes: thoſe had, I place <hi>Arcturus</hi> in my <hi>Reet</hi> according to that Right Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion and Declination (as was taught Book 1 7. and Book 4.18.)

               <p>YOur Planiſphear ſet in the firſt Mode of the Meridional Projection, as in the former Chapter, go to the Parallel of the Declination of the Sun or Star, and follow him through all the Meridians from the <hi>Finiter</hi> to the <hi>Limb;</hi> (which is the Meridian of your Place;) and thence back again to the <hi>Fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and you ſhall find at the firſt ſight what <hi>Almicanter</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimuth</hi> croſs the Parallel in any point propoſed: and ſo have you the Altitude and <hi>Azimuth</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>Example. <hi>June</hi> 10. the Sun was in the <hi>Tropique</hi> of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and ſo makes his diurnal revolution in the 23 ½ Parallel of Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; I follow this Parallel, the <hi>Tropique,</hi> from the Horizon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and having gone 4 degrees, I meet the ragged arch or hour line of 4. (which is the 120th. Meridian from the South) there croſſeth the ſecond <hi>Almicantar,</hi> and the three and fiftieth <hi>Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth</hi> from the North; whereby I learn that at 4. in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>June</hi> 10, the Sun is 2 degrees high; and in <hi>Azimuth</hi> from the North 53. Thence going on 15 degrees, I come to the hour circle of 5. where cutteth the 10th. <hi>Almicantar</hi> almoſt, and <hi>Azimuth</hi> 64 degrees, and better: going 15 degrees further I come to the Axtree-line, which is the hour circle of 6. and there I find the Suns Altitude 18 degrees, and his <hi>Azimuth</hi> from the North 75 degrees, &amp;c. And look what Altitudes and <hi>Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muths</hi> I find at 4, 5, 6. &amp;c, in the Morning, the ſame I find at
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:101831:51"/>the afternoon hours, that have like diſtance from Noon: becauſe the Eaſtern and Weſtern Hemiſphears are alike, and the ſame lines ſerve them both.</p>
               <p>Thus you may do in any other Parallel, and for any Star, as well as the Sun; having his Declination given. And ſo you may make Tables of the Suns Altitude and <hi>Azimuth,</hi> at every hour, and quarter of an hour, if you pleaſe, for every day through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the year: and that as faſt as you can write them, without changing the poſture of the Planiſphear at all.</p>

               </head>
               <p>USe for this the Equinoctial Projection. And if the Star be in your <hi>Reet,</hi> turn him to the North or South of the Meridian line, or to the Eaſt or Weſt part of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon in your Planiſphear, as you ſee him in the Heaven. Then turn the <hi>Label</hi> to the Suns place in the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> of the <hi>Reet,</hi> and it ſhall ſhew the hour in the <hi>Limb:</hi> but if the Star be not in the <hi>Reet,</hi> you ſhall ſupply him by the ſhift uſed Chap. 18.</p>
               <p>Example. <hi>March</hi> 10th. I ſaw <hi>Sirius</hi> ſetting in the South-Weſt; and having turned him to the ſame place in my Plani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphear, I laid the <hi>Label</hi> to ♈ 0. which was the Suns place for that day; and it cut in the <hi>Limb</hi> 11. hours 3 minutes paſt noon.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>December</hi> 1. Seeing <hi>Lucida Pleiadum</hi> in the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, I turned the Star till he touched the Meridian line of the <hi>Mater;</hi> then laying the <hi>Label</hi> to ♐ 19. the place of the Sun, I found it was 10. hours 17. minutes at Night,</p>
               <p>The ſame Night I ſaw <hi>Ras Aben,</hi> or the brighteſt in the <hi>Dragons head</hi> under the Pole, in the North part of the Meridian; wherefore I placed him on the Meridian line between the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and <hi>Septentrio:</hi> and the <hi>Label</hi> laid to ♐ 19. ſhewed me it was 12. 36. minutes; that is more then half an hour paſt Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.</p>

               <p>LAy the Suns place to the hour given, in the Equinoctial Projection, then may you preſently ſee all the Stars of the <hi>Reet</hi> in what Coaſt they are, whether under the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon or above, and how many hours they lack, or are paſt either the Horizon or Meridian.</p>
               <p>Example. Sitting within dores at ſeven of the clock on <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> day at Night, I deſired to know what Stars were ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and what near the Meridian, wherefore laying ♑ 14. to 7. of the clock afternoon, I ſaw in the <hi>Reet</hi> the <hi>Rams horn,</hi> a little paſt South. The <hi>Plaiades</hi> wanted 1. hour 28. minutes of South, as the <hi>Label</hi> ſhewed me in the <hi>Limb;</hi> ♌ was riſing, but <hi>Cor</hi> ♌. not yet up. I would know now what he wanted of riſing, therefore I turned forward the <hi>Reet</hi> till <hi>Cor</hi> ♌ came to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, and obſerved how many degrees of the <hi>Reet</hi> paſſed under the <hi>Label</hi> (or by any point of the <hi>Limb</hi>) while the <hi>Reet</hi> turned: and I found that ♈ 0 (and ſo any other point) moved on in the <hi>Limb</hi> 10 degrees in the while that <hi>Cor</hi> ♌ was comming to the Horizon. Whereupon I underſtood that he would riſe 40 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes after.</p>

               <p>BY this Chapter you may find the time of Night, at any time, by any Star, if he be viſible above the Horizon.

                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:101831:54"/>Example. <hi>December</hi> 25. I obſerved <hi>Procyon</hi> to be full Eaſt, his Declination North, is 6 degrees 3 minutes. In the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Projection I looked where the <hi>Axis</hi> of the <hi>Reet</hi> (which is the Eaſt <hi>Azimuth</hi>) cut the ſixth of the North Parallels, and I found the interſection 1 degree South-ward from the Axtree of the <hi>Mater</hi> (or hour-line of ſix) there alſo cutteth the 5 ½ <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micantar,</hi> which ſhewes more then I ſought, that <hi>Procyon</hi> was 5 degrees 30 minutes above the Horizon.

               </head>
               <p>THis Caſe differeth little from the Caſe of Chapter 26. where, from the ſame things given, the Declination and hour was required. For the hour and Right Aſcenſion are in a ſort the ſame thing, only the account of the Right Aſcenſion beginneth alwayes at ♈ 0. and is made in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and minutes of a degree. The account of the Hour beginneth at the Meridian, and is made in hours and minutes of an hour. Fifteen whole degrees make an hour, and conſequently 15 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of a Degree make one minute of Time, for in every minute of Time, there paſſeth the Meridian a quarter of a degree of the Equinoctial. The time of Night is here further required to be given; which may be had by Chap 29. or 32.</p>
               <p>The rule. When you obſerve the Altitude and <hi>Azimuth</hi> of the Star, obſerve alſo the time of Night, by Chapter 29. or 32.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101831:54"/>and to ſave you labour herein, you ſhall do beſt to obſerve your Altitude and <hi>Azimuth,</hi> when ſome known Star is ſeen juſt in the Meridian. Then with your Latitude, and the Altitude, and <hi>Azimuth</hi> of the Star, get by Chapter 26. the Declination, and hour of the Star: Then in the Equinoctial Projection, lay the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the Sun to the hour of the Night: thence turn the <hi>Label</hi> to the hour of the Star, and you have his Right Aſcenſion in the <hi>Limb</hi> of the <hi>Reet,</hi> between ♈ 0 and the <hi>Label.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Example. Put caſe I would find the Declination and Right Aſcenſion of <hi>Lucida Pleiadum.</hi> The Sun being in <hi>Sagittarius</hi> 20. <hi>December</hi> 2. I obſerved that when <hi>Auſtralis caudae Caeti</hi> is full South, <hi>Lucida Pleiadum</hi> was near South-eaſt <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Azimuth</hi> 67. from the Meridian, and the Altitude of the ſaid Star 45. 0. hence, by Chapter 26. I find his Declination 23 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees North, and the hour-diſtance from the Meridian 45 degr. that is 3 hours before noon. Then in the Equinoctial Projecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (according to Chapter 29.) I ſet <hi>Auſtralis caud. Cati</hi> in the Meridian line of the <hi>Mater.</hi> and turning the <hi>Label</hi> to 9. of the clock (which is the hour of the Star) I find in the <hi>Limb</hi> of the <hi>Reet</hi> (numbring from ♈ 0, to the <hi>Label</hi>) 52 degrees, the Right Aſcenſion of <hi>Lucida Pleiadum:</hi> and where the 23 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the <hi>Label</hi> now touches the <hi>Reet,</hi> there may I prick the Star in my <hi>Reet,</hi> if I have him not before; the time of night is eaſily ſeen, by turning the <hi>Label</hi> to the Suns place, it ſhewes 7. hours 12 minutes at night: but I need not ſo much as look on that, though by placing <hi>Auſtralis caud. Caeti</hi> in the South, I have the time implicitely. The Propoſition therefore, might have been thus made; Your Latitude known, and the Altitude and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimuth</hi> of an unknown Star obſerved, juſt at the time when any known Star is in the Meridian; to find both the Right Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Declination of the Star unknown.</p>
               <p>Note alſo, that if you obſerve the unknown Star in the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Azimuth,</hi> you have preſently his Declination, by Chapter 13. and the Right Aſcenſion of <hi>Culmen Caeli,</hi> is the Stars Right Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion.</p>

               </head>
               <p>LOok the Stars place in the <hi>Mater,</hi> (which is the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection of the Meridian of his Right Aſcenſion with the Parallel of his Declination) and make a prick there. Then your Planiſphear being ſet in the ſecond Mode of the Meridional Projection, you ſhall preſently find the Longitude and Latitude in the <hi>Reet:</hi> for the <hi>Azimuth</hi> cutting the ſaid prick, ſhewes his Longitude, and the <hi>Almicantar</hi> his Latitude.</p>
               <p>Example. <hi>November</hi> 14. 1639. I obſerved a Star of the third Magnitude in the Heart of <hi>Cetus,</hi> which I know to be no common Star, becauſe I had never noted it before, neither could I find it in the Tables of <hi>Ptolemy, Tycho,</hi> or any other: the Right Aſcenſion thereof was 30. 13 minutes, the Declination 4. 50. minutes South, as I obſerved by 2 way which hereafter ſhall be ſhewed Chapter 44. I made therefore a prick with ink in the <hi>Mater</hi> of my Braſs Planiſphear, where the 30th. Meridian (numbred from the Center toward my right hand) and the 5th. Parallel of South Declination do croſs; regarding alſo the odd minutes. Then as ſoon as my ink was drie, I ſet the Finitor in the <hi>Ecliptique</hi> line of the <hi>Mater</hi> with the <hi>Zenith</hi> South-wards; becauſe the Latitude of the Star was South, and I ſaw the 26. <hi>Azimuth</hi> from the Axtree line cutting the prick, and likewiſe the 16th. <hi>Almicantar</hi> cutting about 10 minutes below the prick toward the Finiter. Therefore becauſe in this Mode the <hi>Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muths</hi> be Circles of Longitude, and the <hi>Almicantars</hi> Parallels of Latitude, (by Book 2.1.) I conclude the Longitude of <hi>Cor Caeti.</hi> was ♈ 26. and his Latitude 16. 10 minutes South.</p>
               <p>When firſt I obſerved this ſtrange Star in the ſaid year 1639. and could find no mention of it in the Tables of <hi>Ptolemy, Coperni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Stadius, Tycho,</hi> or <hi>Maginus,</hi> I did thereof advertiſe my very good friends D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>John Twyſden,</hi> then in <hi>Kent,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Samuel Foſter,</hi> Profeſſor of <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> in <hi>Greſham Colledge,</hi> then at <hi>London;</hi> who thereupon made the ſame obſervation of the Star that I had done, for the place of it; and we all agreed that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in light, and was above the third Magnitude in <hi>December</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:101831:55"/>1639. and that it had no perceivable Parallax. And as I was thinking to publiſh ſome brief advertiſment thereof, in the Latin tongue, that <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> beyond the Seas as well as here, might attend the obſervation thereof, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Foſter</hi> wrote me word that he had found the Star pictured in <hi>Bayerus</hi> his Images, which were printed <hi>Anno Domi.</hi> 1616. And in 1640. there came to me through D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Twyſdens</hi> hands a Treatiſe of that Star, then newly Printed, by one <hi>Phacylides,</hi> Profeſſor of <hi>Logique</hi> at <hi>Frane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers,</hi> whoſe obſervations agreed with ours. But he thought this Star to have been made of the great <hi>Eclipſe</hi> of the Moon which hapned <hi>December</hi> 10. 1638. in the foremoſt foot of ♊. wherein we were not of his mind, you may read this conceipt in his Book pag. 197. This Star doth often appear, and again diſappear; it is ſometime of the 3d. Magnitude, ſometime of the 4th. I have ſeen it oft in the Eaſtern Hemiſphear, ſeldome in the Weſtern. It is loſt ſometimes divers weekes together: this year I could never ſee it, till <hi>February</hi> 2. 1656/7. Such as have leaſure for the Study of theſe Arts, may do well to obſerve it, and to ſearch the reaſon of its changes: for which purpoſe I thought it fit to give this notice.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THis Probleme is the converſe of the precedent. The Stars are regiſtred by their Longitudes and Latitudes, becauſe their Longitudes increaſe equally, and their Latitudes remain the ſame. And ſo the Tables are eaſily rectified to any Age, by Addition or Subtraction of a few degrees or minutes of Longitude onely: but the Right Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Declination of the Stars happen to increaſe and decreaſe very unequally, and muſt therefore be calculated from Age to Age, from the Longitude and Latitude whoſe Tables are more certain.</p>
               <p>Set the Planiſphear in the ſecond Mode of the Meridional Projection, as in the former Chapter, and bearing in mind that the <hi>Azimuths</hi> here are Circles of Longitude and the <hi>Almican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>

               <p>Example. <hi>Eniph. Alpharats,</hi> that is, <hi>Os Pegaſi,</hi> had by <hi>Tycho'es</hi> Tables <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1600. Longitude ♒ 26. 22 minutes, Latitude 22.07 ½. North. The Finiter ſet to the <hi>Ecliptique</hi> line of the <hi>Mater,</hi> and the <hi>Zenith</hi> toward the North Pole (becauſe the Stars Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is North) I count the Longitude of the Star upon the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niter, (here <hi>Ecliptique</hi>) thus. At the Center ſay I, is ♈ 0. thence proceeding rightward to the <hi>Limb,</hi> I ſay, here is ♋ 0. whoſe Right Aſcenſion is 90. thence returning to the Center, I ſay, here is ♎ 0. upon the Axis of the <hi>Reet</hi> and Right Aſcenſion 180. upon the Axis of the <hi>Mater;</hi> thence I proceed in the <hi>Finiter</hi> to the other ſide of the <hi>Limb,</hi> and ſay here is ♑ 0. bounded by the <hi>Limb</hi> of the <hi>Reet</hi> and Right Aſcenſion 270. bounded by the <hi>Limb</hi> of the <hi>Mater,</hi> which <hi>Limbs</hi> here fall into one Circle; and are <hi>Colurus Solſtitiorum:</hi> theſe numbers I keep, and returning back in the <hi>Finiter</hi> toward the Center, when I am gone 30 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, I ſay, here begins ♒. and going on 26. 22. minutes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I ſay, thus far is the Star gone in Longitude. Now here cuts the <hi>Finiter</hi> (by this account) the <hi>Azimuth</hi> 35 ⅓. from the <hi>Limb;</hi> in this <hi>Azimuth</hi> I number the Stars Latitude, by the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micantars</hi> 22.07 ½. and at the end of that number in the ſaid <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimuth</hi> I prick the Stars place. And here I ſee the 8th. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel of North Declination upon the <hi>Mater</hi> cutteth him, and the Meridian 51 ⅓. from the <hi>Limb</hi> ſhewing the exceſs of his Right Aſcenſion above 270. which I kept before. Therefore I conclude the Right Aſcenſion of <hi>Eniph. Alpharats, Anno Dom.</hi> 1600, was 321. 20 minutes; and his Declination 8. deg. North.</p>

They be all Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons to ſome Country or other in the World, and therefore are moſt fitly repreſented by the Horizons of the <hi>Mater.</hi> The Firſt Houſe beginneth alwayes at the <hi>Aſcendent:</hi> and the reſt follow in order according to the Sequel of the Signes. But <hi>Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> are not well agreed about their ſituation. For 1. Some will have the domifying Circles drawn from the Poles of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptique</hi> through every 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. degree thereof, as <hi>Ptolemie.</hi> 2. Some draw them from the Poles of the World, through every 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:101831:63"/>degree of the Equator; as <hi>Alcabitius.</hi> 3. Some draw them from the interſections of the Meridian and Horizon, through e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very 30th. degree of the Equator; as <hi>Regiomontanus.</hi> 4. Some draw them from the ſame interſections, by every 30th. degree of the <hi>Prime Vertical</hi> or Eaſt <hi>Azimuth;</hi> as <hi>Campanus.</hi> Yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> will pretend he can tell you your Fortune, though they go about it ſo divers wayes, that they may be all falſe, and but one of them can be true: and no Man hath ſhewed any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon for his way then another, but his own opinion.</p>
               <p>If you will follow the firſt or ſecond way, the matter is plain. For in the firſt way every 30th Circle of Longitude reckoned from the Aſcendent downwards, and ſo round, is a <hi>Domifying</hi> Circle: and likewiſe every 30th. Meridian from the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is a <hi>Domifying</hi> Circle in the Second way. And if you know but what Longitude a Star hath, you preſently find in what Houſe he is, after the firſt way. And if you know the Right Aſcenſion of a Star, and of the Aſcendent, you preſently find in what Houſe he is, after the ſecond way.</p>
               <p>But if you will uſe the third way (now commonly uſed) you ſhall ſet the <hi>Zonith</hi> line of the <hi>Reet</hi> to the Latitude, and ſo the <hi>Azimuths</hi> are your Circles of Poſition; then look what <hi>Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth</hi> cutteth every 30th degree of the Equinoctial, that is a <hi>Domifying</hi> Circle; and you ſhall reckon here from the <hi>Limb,</hi> which ſhall ſtand for the beginning of the 10th. Houſe, and ſo in our Horizon 52 ¼. the fourty third <hi>Azimuth</hi> cutteth the 30th. degree of the Equator, ſerving the 11th. and third Houſe: and the <hi>Azimuth</hi> 70 ½ cutteth the 60th. degree of the Equator, ſerving the 12th and ſecond Houſes: and becauſe I know that on the other ſide the Center the Interſections will be like, I look no further.</p>
               <p>But now I muſt get the Depreſſions of theſe Circles under the Pole in this manner. I number in the fourty third <hi>Azimuth</hi> the Latitude of my Place from the <hi>Zenith;</hi> to the end of which number I lay the <hi>Label,</hi> and I ſee the <hi>Azimuth</hi> cutting on the <hi>Label</hi> 32 ½ for the depreſſion of that Circle. And in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, laying the <hi>Label</hi> upon the 52 degrees ¼ of the <hi>Azimuth</hi> 70 ½ I find on the <hi>Label</hi> his depreſſion 48 degrees; by the third Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of Rectangl.

               <p>Theſe Horizons therefore I chooſe out in the <hi>Mater, viz.</hi> 32 ½, and 48. for theſe with the Meridian and Horizon of my Place,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:101831:64"/>ſhall ſerve to get the Houſes for ever, in my Latitude: for the 32 ½ Horizon ſhall be the beginning of the 11th. and third Houſes; and the 48th, the beginning of the 12th and Second, Thus have I the Circles of Poſition of the 11, 12, 2, and 3. Houſes: and the 10th. and firſt, are had by the former Chapter: and theſe ſix being had, I have all; for oppoſite Hemiſphears are alwayes alike, and one deſcription ſerveth both.</p>

For thoſe Stars which in <hi>Nabonaſſars</hi> time were in the <hi>Dodeca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temorion</hi> of ♈, are all removed into the <hi>Dodecatemoria</hi> of ♉, and ♊; and thoſe of ♓ and ♒ are come in their roomes: for the fixed Stars are found to paſs through a whole Signe, that is, a 12th. part of the Compaſs of the Heaven, in 2118. Years; and it is now above 1900. Years ſince <hi>Ptolemie</hi> wrote, and above 2400. ſince <hi>Nabonaſſar</hi> began his Reign. 2. That <hi>Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> ſcarce look beyond the <hi>Zodiaque</hi> for their <hi>Aſpects,</hi> whereas the fixed Stars on the North and South may have, for ought they know, as operative configurations with the Planets, as the Planets one with another. 3. That their own Rules are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold, and the Planets and fixed Stars and their Aſpects alſo are ſo many, and ſo divers in qualities and degrees, that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to judge what effect the mixture of thoſe influences ſhall produce: eſpecially conſidering that from the beginning of the World to this time, the Heavenly bodies never had twice the ſame poſture: and therefore there wants experiment to build the Art upon.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Meteorological</hi> part, I was much helped by the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of my Father, who for 10. Years did moſt curiouſly obſerve all changes of Wind and Weather, while <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was waking; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them daily over againſt the dayes in <hi>Maginus</hi> his <hi>Epheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides.</hi> His concluſion was, that he could find no certainty in the rules of <hi>Aſtrology</hi> commonly received, nor frame any other upon his experience. Yet had I a mind to try a little further, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Year 1631 and forward for ſome years, I made dayly Obſervations of all Winds and Weather at home, and got alſo the beſt information I could by Letters from Friends abroad, by relation of Travellers, <hi>Journals</hi> of Sea-men, <hi>Curranto'es</hi> (as they
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:101831:68"/>were then called) <hi>Mercurius Gallabelgicus,</hi> &amp;c. And I found ſo great diverſity of Weather in the ſame Climate, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in places ſcarce three degrees diſtant in Longitude or Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that I diſpaired of Progneſticating Weather, till I could learn which way the Wind would liſt to blow. This among my Obſervations is memorable, that the Weather <hi>Capt. James</hi> had in his Voyage, Wiatering and return from the Mid-land Sea of <hi>America,</hi> was very divers from ours, and oft times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and all the agreement I could find, was, that one day when it Thundred in <hi>America</hi> very ſore, we had Thunder 18. hours after: yet he was many moneths in <hi>Charlton Iſland,</hi> which is in our Latitude; where his Ship was ſo Frozen, and the Sea ſo full of Ice, that he could not ſail till <hi>May.</hi> And I know a learned Gentleman that uſed for a recreation at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> time to put a Dozen new Almanacks into the hands of ſo many of his ſervants, and ſet them to read in order the ſeveral judgements of the Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticaters about the Weather; wherein he found as good ſport as <hi>William Duke</hi> of <hi>Mantua</hi> did in reading the judgements of ſeveral <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> upon a Figure erected upon the Nativity of his young <hi>Mule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>Genethliacal</hi> part, ſince Planets ſignifie diverſly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Houſes in which they are, it were very needfull for Men of this craft, firſt to demonſtrate how the Houſes ought to be divided, before they undertake to give any judgement: but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are not agreed: thoſe Stars which after <hi>Ptolemy</hi> are in one Houſe, and ſignifie thus; after <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> are in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Houſe for the ſame time and place, and ſo ſignifie otherwiſe. Of the four wayes above mentioned Chapter 48. I cannot ſay which is beſt: but that of <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> which is now moſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and called by ſome the Rational way, ſeemes to me the moſt Irrational of all, becauſe of the very unequal diviſion of the Houſes: for let a man Erect a Figure for <hi>Wardhuys</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> after that way, and he ſhall find the 4 Houſes next the Meridian, <hi>viz.</hi> 3, 4, 9, 11. hugely great, each of them containing above a ſeventh part of the Sphear; and the 4 Houſes next the Horizon each of them not to contain a twenty fourth part; he ſhall alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that all the Stars within 48 degrees of either Pole (which take up a full third part of the Sphear) are perpetually confined to two Houſes ½ for that Parallel; though in warmer Climates ſome of them have a little more liberty; but <hi>Ptolomie</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabitius</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:101831:69"/>gives every Star the Liberty of all the Houſes, and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panus</hi> Impriſons but a few.</p>
               <p>I could never ſee any good reaſon why the influences of the Stars ſhould make more impreſſion upon the Child in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Nativity, then they did at any time before in the Womb. If mines in the Earth are not hidden from the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Stars, neither is the Child in the Mothers belly. If the Stars have ſuch operation on Men in their Nativity, it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall to think they have more force in their firſt conception, when the matter is fluid and more apt to receive impreſſion, then when the Child is ſhaped, and the temper more confirmed: and this <hi>Johannes Angeli</hi> an old <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> conſidering, framed a Table to diſcover to a minute the time of conception, by the time of the Birth given, where he extends the time of geſtation to 40. Weeks, and (as I remember,) 6 dayes over; but he doth not tell us whether he made that Table by experience, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination; nor how many experiments he had uſed for the triall of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Favorinus</hi> once demanded of theſe <hi>Genethliacal</hi> men, who pretend to know mens Fortunes by the Poſitions of the Stars in their Nativity. How it comes to paſs that thouſands of people, of both Sexes, of all Ages, born in ſundry places, and under ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry configurations of the Stars, have hapned to periſh in the ſame hour and moment, and by the ſame misfortune, as by Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, Stormes of War, Earth-quakes, fall of Buildings, and ſuch like accidents? And whether this fate could have been foreſeen in all the Figures Erected for their-ſeveral Nativities? Which demand I think never yet received any good anſwer.</p>
               <p>This alſo I have long obſerved that no Man (ſo far as my knowledge and intelligence reacheth) are ſo Fortunate in ſetting Figures for diſcovering things loſt, or Prognoſticating of Life and Death, as ſome who ſcarce know <hi>Charles Wain,</hi> nor any Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net in the Skie beſide the Sun and Moon: and ſome of theſe have given out that I allowed of their practiſes, before ever they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted me, and ſo gave me occaſion to make this digreſſion.

               <p>IN the Equinoctial Projection ſet the Suns place to the time propoſed, and get the Altitude of <hi>Culmen Caeli,</hi> by Chapter 46. Then, if the Eaſtern arch of the Ecliptique be ſhorter then the Weſtern, you ſhall count the degrees between the Aſcendent and Mid-heaven; otherwiſe count from the Defcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Mid-heaven. Number theſe degrees on the <hi>Label</hi> from the Center, and where they end make a prick; which prick if you put upon the Parallel of the Altitude of <hi>Culmen Caeli,</hi> you ſhall have in the <hi>Limb,</hi> between the <hi>Finitor</hi> and the <hi>Label,</hi> the meaſure of the leſſer angle, which taken out of 180 degrees lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the greater angle. This is done by Probleme 2. Rectang. And note that the leſſer angle, and the Altitude of the <hi>Nonageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus gradus</hi> be alwayes equal.</p>
               <p>Example. <hi>March</hi> 29. 1652. 10. hours 32. minutes <hi>a. m.</hi> ♓ 25 ½ was in <hi>Culmine:</hi> the Meridian Altitude thereof is 36. Between <hi>Culmen</hi> and the Deſcendent I find 61 ½. therefore I prick the degree 61 ½ from the Center in the <hi>Label;</hi> and when I have turned that prick to the 36. <hi>Almicantar,</hi> the <hi>Label</hi> ſhewes in the <hi>Limb</hi> of the <hi>Reet</hi> 42 degrees for the leſſer angle of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptique</hi> with the Horizon (exactly 41. 58 minutes) which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is the Altitude of the <hi>Nonageſimus gradus:</hi> the greater angle is 138 degrees 2 minutes.</p>
               <p>Another way. In the Equinoctial Projection: lay the <hi>Label</hi> on the <hi>Nonageſimus gradus;</hi> and obſerve his Declination on the <hi>Label,</hi> and his Horary diſtance from the Meridian. Then in the Meridional Projection and his firſt mode, obſerve where that Declination and Horary diſtance meet on the <hi>Mater,</hi> and the <hi>Almicantar</hi> touching the ſame point ſheweth the Altitude of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageſimus gradus,</hi> which is equal to the angle ſought.</p>
               <p>Example. In the former Caſe, where ♓ 25 ½ was in our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, ♈ 24. was <hi>Nonageſimus gradus;</hi> the <hi>Label</hi> laid to it ſhewed me his Declination 9 ½ almoſt, North: and his Horary

And there cometh unasked alſo, the 36 ⅓ <hi>Azimuth</hi> being the <hi>Azmuth</hi> of the <hi>Nonageſimus gradus,</hi> which is alwayes equal to the Amplitude of the Aſcendent.

               <p>Example. <hi>Febr.</hi> 13, 1657/8. I obſerved (ſomewhat near) that ♃ was gone Weſt-ward from the Meridian in <hi>Azimuth</hi> 14 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and that his Altitude was 61 degrees; <hi>Sirius</hi> was then in the Meridian, by which I have the <hi>Aſcendent, Culmen,</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageſimus gradus,</hi> any or all of them given.

               <p>Wherefore by the third Probleme of Rectangled Triangles, Book 3. 5. you may preſently get both the legs.</p>
               <p>Example. The Parallactical angle B, was found Chapter 62. to be 86. 41 minutes, and the Parallax of the Moons Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, (Chapter 63.) to be 46 ½ minutes for the ſame time. Here therefore having laid the <hi>Label</hi> to 86. 41 minutes from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial, I number in the <hi>Label</hi> from the Center 46 degrees and an half (in ſtead of 46 minutes and an half the Parallax of Altitude) and I find that the 46 ⅓ Parallel cutteth the ſaid 46 ½, degree of the <hi>Label;</hi> by which I know that the Leg C A for the Parallax of Latitude is 46 ⅓ very near, (for the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> here being near the <hi>Nonageſimus gradus</hi> all her Parallax almoſt goes into Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude,) but B A of my Triangle is covered by the head of my <hi>Label.</hi> Nevertheleſs I may ſee his meaſure in any of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels to be 3 ½ minutes for the Parallax of Longitude, for it is the 3 ½ Meridian from the Axis, which cutteth 46 ½ of the <hi>Label:</hi> and if I had not this ſhift, I might have my choice of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhifts, ſhewed Book 3. the 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chapters.</p>
               <p>The Suns Parallax of Altitude Chapter 63 for the ſame time was found 1 minute ½. therefore laying the <hi>Label</hi> to the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lactique angle (as before) I number on the <hi>Label</hi> for the ſide B C (the Suns Parallax of Altitude, being 1 minute ½) 9 degrees, ſo every degree here ſignifieth 10 ſeconds; and I find there cutting almoſt the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Parallel, ſhewing me that C A the Parallax of the Suns Latitude is 1 ½ minute almoſt (that is almoſt as much as his Parallax of Altitude) and there cutteth alſo the Meridian 0 ⅔, ſhewing me that the ſide B A, Parallax of Longitude, is almoſt 7 ſeconds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:101831:76"/>The Sun therefore (though he never have Latitude) by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Parallax, appeared in the middle of this Eclipſe to have South Latitude 1 ½ minute, the Moons true Latitude was then by <hi>Lantsbergius</hi> his Tables 45 minutes, 24 ſeconds North; ſo that by this accompt the Sun and Moons Centers were diſtant in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude 46 minutes, 54 ſeconds: but when out of this diſtance you have ſubtracted 46 ⅓ for the Moons Parallax of Latitude, there remains 34 ſeconds for the apparent diſtance of the Centers of the Sun and Moon. But by Obſervation, I found them diſtant 1 minute 48 ſeconds: for the digits Eclipſed at <hi>Ecton,</hi> were 11. 22 ½ minutes; and ſo perhaps might I have found by my Planiſphear, or ſome what near, had it been large enough, and had I regarded every minute and ſecond preciſely in ſetting down this Example, which were more then needed for my purpoſe in this place.</p>

               <p>A <hi>Climate</hi> is ſuch a Parallel as altereth the length of the day half an hour. The Parallels and Climates begin from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator, under which the day is alwayes equal to the Night, and each 12 hours long: hence they count the Parallels and Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates Northward, and Southward: but becauſe the Earth was not ſo far known to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and the Ancient <hi>Geographers,</hi> as it hath been to thoſe of later Times, therefore there is great difference between the Ancient and later <hi>Geographers</hi> about the number and quantity of the ſpaces contained by them: as among others <hi>Kerkerman Syſt.

               <p>Yet may they eaſily be found to every Mans mind, by the Planiſphear in the Meridional Projection, thus.

               <p>If the places differ only in Latitude, and have one Longitude, bearing full North or South one from another; then take their difference of Latitude, by ſubducting the leſs out of the greater, if the places have both North Latitude, or both South Latitude: or take the ſum of their Latitude, if one be North, and the other South. Then for every degree of this difference or aggregate number, you may reckon 69 ½ Engliſh. miles of the Statute, which ordaineth 1760. Yards to be a Mile: but of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Miles meaſured by common eſtimation, there go not above 60. to a degree; ſo that every ſuch Mile that you Travel North or South ſhall alter your Latitude about one minute. If they differ in Longitude onely, and have no Latitude, but be both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Equator, you ſhall reckon in like manner for every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree they differ in Longitude 69 ½ Miles of diſtance.</p>
               <p>In all other Caſes you have a Triangle ſoluble by the ſecond Probleme of Obliquangled Triangles: of which Triangle the Complements of Latitude make the two comprehending ſides, and the difference of the Longitudes of the places is the angle comprehended between them, and the third ſide is the arch of the diſtance of the places; which when you have found in degrees and minutes of a great Circle, you may turn into Miles as before: mark how the diſtance of two Stars is found by their Longitude and Latitude given, Chapter 37. in the ſame manner may you find the diſtance of two Cities or Towns.</p>
               <p>Example. I would know the diſtance of <hi>London</hi> from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> The Complement of the Latitude of <hi>London</hi> is 38. 28 minutes: the Complement of the Latitude of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is 58. 05 minutes: the difference of their Longitudes 46. 0 minutes.

               </head>
               <p>THis is done eaſily enough without an Inſtrument: for if you turn the difference of Longitude into hours and minutes, and add the ſame to your hours for any place which lies Eaſtward, or ſubtract the ſame for any place which lies Weſtward, you ſhall make the hour of the place.</p>
               <p>Example. The difference of Longitude between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is 46. or being converted into time 3 hours 4 minutes: therefore adding this to the time at <hi>London,</hi> I ſay, when it is noon at <hi>London,</hi> it is 4 minutes paſt 3 a clock after noon at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:</hi> and when it is 2 a clock at <hi>London,</hi> it is 5. and 4 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you will do it by the Planiſphear, you ſhall do it in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial Projection, thus. Whereas the <hi>Limb</hi> of your <hi>Rect</hi> is graduated into 360 degrees, if you diſtinguiſh the hours alſo at every 15th degree, beginning at the <hi>Zenith</hi> (which ſhall be 12) and numbring thence in the <hi>Limb</hi> of your <hi>Reet</hi> to your right hand or Weſtward, 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. then ſhall you need to do no more but ſet the <hi>Zenith</hi> to the difference of Longitude, Eaſt or Weſt from your Meridian, as the ſtrange place happeneth to be ſituate: for then the <hi>Label</hi> laid to the hour of your Country in the Limb of the Mater, ſhall ſhew the hour of the other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the <hi>Limb</hi> of the <hi>Reet.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Zenith</hi> being laid to 60 degrees Weſtward, which is the Meridian of the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi> the <hi>Label</hi> laid to <hi>Meridies</hi> ſhall cut in the <hi>Limb</hi> of the <hi>Reet</hi> 8 of the clock before noon: which ſheweth me that when it is noon with us, it is at <hi>Barbados</hi> but eight in the morning.</p>

               </head>
               <p>FOr the better underſtanding of the reaſon of Dyals, theſe <hi>Theorems</hi> would be known.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That every plain whereupon any Dyal is drawn, is part of the plain of great Circle of the Heaven: which Circle is an Horizon to ſome Country or other: that the Center of the Dyal repreſents the Center of the Earth and World, and the <hi>Gnomon</hi> which caſteth the ſhade repreſenteth the Axis, and ought to point directly to the two Poles. And if upon the Center of the Dyal you faſten a <hi>Label</hi> with Sights of equal Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and keeping your eye in the line of the Sights turn this <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> round, you ſhall thereby deſcribe in the Heavens that great Circle wherein your Dyal-plain lies, and ſee where it cuts our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, and how much it is Elevated above it on one ſide, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on the other.</item>
                  <item>2. That thoſe Dyal-plains <hi>Geometrically</hi> are not in the very plains of great Circles; for then they ſhould have their Centers in the Center of the Earth, from which they are removed almoſt 4000. Miles: and in truth they lie in the plains of Circles Parallel to the ſaid Horizons, but ſo near them, that Optically they ſeem to be the plains of thoſe Horizons: becauſe the Semidiameter of the Earth beareth ſo ſmal proportion to the Suns diſtance, that the whole Earth may be taken for one point or Center, without any perceivable error.</item>
                  <item>3. That (as all great Circles of the Sphear, ſo) every Dyal-plain hath his Axis, which is a ſtraight line paſſing through the Center of the plain, and making right angles with it: and at the ends of the Axis be the two Poles of the plain, whereof that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our Horizon is called the Pole <hi>Zenith,</hi> and the other the Pole <hi>Nadir</hi> of the Dyal.</item>
                  <item>4. That every Dyal-plain hath two faces or ſides: and look what reſpect or ſituation the North Pole of the World hath to the one ſide, the ſame hath the South Pole to the other, and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:101831:82"/>theſe two ſides will alwayes receive 24 hours; ſo that what one ſide wanteth, the other ſide ſhall have; and the one is deſcribed in all things as the other.</item>
                  <item>5. That (as Horizons, ſo) Dyal-plains are with reſpect to the Equator divided into 1. Parallel or Equinoctial, 2. Right, 3. Oblique.</item>
                  <item>6. A Parallel or Polar Dyal-plain maketh no angles with the Equator: but lies in the plain of it, or Parallel to it. Such Dials are <hi>Scioterica Orthognomonica,</hi> that is, have the <hi>Gnomon</hi> erected on the plain at Right angles, as the Axis of the World is upon the plain of the Equator: becauſe the Axis and Poles of the Dyal be here all one with the Axis and Poles of the World: and the hour lines here meet all at the Center, making equal angles, and dividing the Dyal Circle into 24. equal parts as the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do the Equator, in whoſe plain the Dyal lies.</item>
                  <item>7. A right Horizon or Dyal-plain cutteth the Equator at right angles, and ſo cutteth through both the Poles of the World. Therefore ſuch Dyals are <hi>Paralielognomonical:</hi> that is have the <hi>Gnomon</hi> Parallel to the plain, and ſo the hour lines and the hour lines all Parallel one to another: becauſe their plains though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely extended will never cut the Axis of the World. Yet have thoſe Dyals a Center, (though not for the meeting of the hour lines) <hi>viz.</hi> through which the Axis of the Dyal Circle paſſeth, cutting the plain at right angles, and cutting alſo (near e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the projecting of a Dyal) the Center of the World.</item>
                  <item>8. An Oblique Horizon or Dyal-plain cutteth the Equator at Oblique angles: ſuch Dyals are <hi>Scalenognomonical:</hi> that is, have for their <hi>Gnomon</hi> the ſide of a Triangle whoſe angles vary accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the more or leſs Obliquity of the ſaid Horizon: and the <hi>Gnomon</hi> ſhall alwayes make an angle with the plain of ſo many degrees as the Axis of the World maketh with the plain; or as either of the Poles of the World is Elevated above the plain.</item>
                  <item>9. Every Oblique Horizon is divided by the Meridians or Hour Circles of the Sphear into 24. unequal parts: which parts, are alwayes leſſer as they are scarer to the Meridian of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon or plain, and greater as they are further off: and on both ſides the Meridian of the plain the hour Circles which are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtant in Time, are alſo equally diſtant in Space: whence it is that the diviſions of one Quadrant of your Dyal plain being known, the diviſion of the whole Circle is likewiſe known.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:101831:83"/>10. The Hour-lines in an Oblique Dyal are the Sections of the plains of the Hour-circles of the Sphear with the Dial plain. And becauſe the plains of great Circles do alwayes cut one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<figure>
                        <figDesc>diagram</figDesc>
                     </figure> in halfs by Diameters, which are ſtraight lines paſſing through the common Center, therefore lines drawn from the Center of the Dyal to the Interſections of the Hour-circles with the great Circle of the plain, ſhall be thoſe very Sections, and the very Hour-lines of the Dyal.</item>
                  <item>11. Every Dyal-plain (being an Horizon to ſome place in the Earth, as was ſaid <hi>Theorem</hi> 1.) hath his proper Meridian; which is the Meridian cutting through the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oles of the plain, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Right angles with the plain. If the Poles of the Dyal-plain lie in the Meridian of our place; then is the Meridian of the plain all one with the Meridian of the place; and the <hi>Gnomon</hi> or <hi>Style</hi> ſhall ſtand erected upon the Noon-line, or line of 12 a clock, as in all direct Dyals: but if the plain decline, then ſhall the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtylar or line wherein the <hi>Gnomon</hi> ſtandeth, which is the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of the plain, vary from the Noon-line, which is the Meridian of the place: and this variation ſhall be Eaſt if the Declination
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101831:83"/>of the plain be Weſt, and contrarily: becauſe the viſual lines by which the Sphear is projected on Dyal-plains, do all like the beams of a Burning-glaſs interſect or croſs one another in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain point of the <hi>Gnomon</hi> (to be aſſigned at pleaſure, and called <hi>Nodus</hi>) and ſo do all place and depaint themſelves on the Dyal-plain beyond the <hi>Nodus</hi> the contrary way.</item>
                  <item>12. Dyals are moſt aptly denominated from that part of the Sphear where their Poles lie: though ſome Authors have choſen to denominate them from the Circles in which their plains lie: as the Dyal-plain which lieth in the Equinoctial or Parallel to it, is called by many an Equinoctial plain: but I concur with thoſe who would rather call it a Polar-plain; becauſe the Poles thereof are in the Poles of the World.</item>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> How to draw an <hi>Horizontal</hi> or <hi>Vertical</hi> line, upon any plain.</head>
               <p>BEcauſe in the Delineation of moſt Dyals the Horizontal or the Vertical line of the plain muſt firſt be drawn, before you can place the hour-lines; I will ſhew you firſt how to draw either of them. Know this firſt that they croſs one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at Right angles in the Center of the Dyal: and therefore if you can draw either of them, you may draw the other alſo. Alſo in upright plains as are Walls a Quadrant or a Square with a Plumbet applied to the Wall, will ſhew you how to draw both of them very eaſily. Or if you hang a Plumb-line quiet before the Wall when the Sun ſhineth, the ſhadow of it ſhall be a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical line at any time.</p>
               <p>But if the plain incline or recline, you ſhall ſet to it a Square with a Plumbet, and thereby firſt draw the Horizontal line; for when the Plumbet (which muſt play in an hole) hangs Parallel to one ſide of the Square, a line drawn by the other ſhall be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal: that drawn, you ſhall lay your Square flat on the plain, and draw the Vertical from any point of the Horizontal at Right angles by your Square</p>
               <p>Another way is this. Hang your Planiſphear by the handle with his Plumbline, ſo that the Plumbline fall upon one of the Diameters; then ſetting your <hi>Label</hi> and Sights to the other Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:101831:84"/>look through the Sights, and mark where the viſuall line cuts the plain neer to one ſide, and there make a prick, then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect your Sights to the other ſide of the plain, and make another prick, (your <hi>Label</hi> and Plumbline being ſtill at Right angles as before) by theſe two pricks draw a line, and it ſhall be an Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal line. And note, that all lines Parallel to an Horizontal line be Horizontal: and all lines Parallel to a Vertical line be alſo Vertical.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> How to make the <hi>Polar Dyal,</hi> and how to place it.</head>
               <p>THe plain of the Polar Dyal lieth in the Equinoctial: where the 12 cheife Meridians or Hour-circles divide both the Equinoctial and this plain into 24 equal parts. The <hi>Gnomon</hi> ſtands upon the Center at Right angles with the plain. You may learn to make him only by the 6. <hi>Theorem</hi> of the ſecond Chapter.</p>
               <p>Take your Planiſphear in the Equinoctial Projection, and there is your Dyal ready made on the <hi>Limb,</hi> and the Hours al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready marked. Erect now a wyer or thred Perpendicular upon the Center, or hold a Square to the Center, ſo that his top be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually diſtant from all the parts of the Circle: and there is your <hi>Gnomon</hi> placed.</p>
               <p>To place this Dyal do thus. Having (by Book 4.3.) found a Meridian line, if you croſs it with another line, that ſhall be an Eaſt or Weſt line. Have alſo in a readineſs a ſquare board up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which you may faſten your Planiſphear or Dyal-plate with pins, ſcrews, or wax, ſo that the Noon-line may be Parallel to two ſides of the board, and the Eaſt-line to the other two: then ſet the North ſide of the board in the Eaſt line, even now found, and raiſe the South ſide by a Quadrant to the height of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial; and ſo may you place your Dyal in any Window if it be made upon a looſe round plate; but if the plate be ſquare, you need not the board to place it.</p>
               <p>Note that both faces of this Dyal muſt be divided, and the <hi>Gnomon</hi> muſt appear on both ſides, like the ſtick in a Purre (or whirligig) which Children uſe: otherwiſe you muſt turn him upſide down, as oft as the Sun paſſeth the Equinoctial.</p>

               <list>
                  <item>1. The direct or South Equinoctial Dyal, which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Meridian directly, not looking from him to one ſide more then to the other, having his Poles in the Interſections of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial and Meridian.</item>
                  <item>2. The Eaſt or Weſt Equinoctial Dyal, which may alſo be called the Equinoctial Horizontal Dyal: for an Horizontal Dyal declining juſt 90 degrees from the South or North, becomes an Equinoctial Dyal, as well as Horizontal: becauſe there his Poles light upon the Interſection of the Horizon with the Equinoctial. And though this Dyal be of kin to both, yet his <hi>Gnomon</hi> ſhews that he ſhould be ſorted rather with the Equinoctial Dyals then with the Horizontal: for he is <hi>Parallelognomonical:</hi> theſe two ſorts be regular, having their Poles in the four notableſt points of the Equator: the third is ſomewhat Irregular, but may be brought to Rule.</item>
                  <item>3. The Equinoctial Dyal declining, whoſe Poles happen any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe in the Equator between the Horizon and Meridian.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now to make the firſt of theſe, the South Equinoctial Dyal, draw firſt an Horizontal-line upon the plain, and croſs it with a Vertical-line, by Chapter 3. The Interſection of theſe is the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your Dyal, and would be choſen about the middle of the plain. Now your Planiſphear being faſtned to a ſquare board, as in the former Chapter, you ſhall ſet the North ſide of the ſaid board in the Horizontal-line of the plain, ſo that the Axis or Eaſt line of your Planiſphear may be Parallel thereto, and the Noon-line (or Equator line of the <hi>Mater</hi>) may point directly to the Center, making Right angles with the plain, or at leaſt with the Horizontal line thereof: (for it is not material whether the board be upright, ſlope, or lie flat upon the Dial plain) then placing your Sights firſt in the Noon line, they ſhall point to the Center for the point of 12. thence remove your <hi>Label</hi> to 1. of the

Therefore theſe Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als are in all points alike: onely the Subſtylar-line which in the South Equinoctial Dyal is 12. in this Eaſt Equinoctial Dyal is but 6. in the Morning for our Country, becauſe of the difference of Longitude.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, draw a line Parallel to the Contingent line at ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as the plain will afford, as the line E I, and to this you ſhall protract your hour lines, drawing them from every point of the Contingent to this; ſo that they make Right angles with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent and with this Parallel, even as the rounds of a Ladder do with the ſides, but that the diſtance of the rounds of a Ladder are equal, and theſe diſtances be unequal. The <hi>Gnomon</hi> muſt be ſet like a Bridge Perpendicularly over the 6. a clock hour-line, the edge that caſteth ſhadow being Parallel to it, and of ſuch height as the line K G of your Planiſphear, or ſo that if the <hi>Gnomon</hi> fall, his edge may lie in the line of 3. or of 9. of the clock. This alſo may be made ſpeedily by help of the <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,</hi> as the South Equinoctial Dyal.</p>
               <p>For the Weſt Equinoctial Dyal, it is made like the Eaſt in all points; onely it ſhews but the after Noon hours, as the Eaſt ſhews but thoſe of the fore noon.

               <p>Draw through Z an Equinoctial or Contingent line E Z, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Right angles with the Axis M E N or Z P, then ſetting Z O equal to Z E, draw upon the Center O (with an extenſion of the Compaſſes,) the arch of the Equinoctial <hi>b</hi> Z <hi>d,</hi> or the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel arch paſſing by D.

               <p>A B is a Wall or plain declining Eaſt by the arch S <hi>p,</hi> to which E B or W A are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, for ſo much as the Wall bendeth from the Eaſt <hi>Azimuth,</hi> ſo much doth his Pole at <hi>p</hi> decline or bend from the Meridian.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:101831:90"/>1. Now to find how much any plain declineth, and ſo in what <hi>Azimuth</hi> he lies, one good way is this: when the Sun begins to inlighten the Wall, or when he leaves it, then is the Sun in the ſame <hi>Azimuth</hi> with the Wall; take at that inſtant his Altitude, and thereby get his <hi>Azimuth</hi> (according to Book 4.27.) and that is the <hi>Azimuth</hi> of the Wall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another way, Firſt draw upon the Wall an Horizontal line, by Chapter 3. then your Planiſphear being faſtned to a Square board (as in Chapter 4.) ſet one ſide of the board to that Horizontal line or Parallel to it and fix there your board and Planiſphear level, by the help of a Square ſet under him like a bracket, the place your <hi>Label</hi> and Sights in one of the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of your Planiſphear, and mark when the Sun comes into the line of the <hi>Label,</hi> caſting the ſhadow of one Sight upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if the <hi>Label</hi> be then in the Diameter which is Parallel to the Wall, then is the Sun at that time in the <hi>Azimuth</hi> of the Wall: if the <hi>Label</hi> be in the other Diameter which is Perpendicular to the Wall, then the Sun coming to it is in the <hi>Azimuth</hi> of the Pole of the plain.</p>
               <p>Now having the hour, or the Altitude of the Sun get his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimuth</hi> (by 4.27,) the ſame is the <hi>Azimuth</hi> of the Wall or plain, if the <hi>Label</hi> were Parallel to the Wall; or the ſame is the <hi>Azimuth</hi> of the Pole of the plain (that is the very Declination) if the <hi>Label</hi> ſtood Perpendicular to the Wall.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another way, If you have not time to watch till the Sun come into the <hi>Azimuth</hi> of the Wall or the Vertical of it, which cutteth the Pole thereof, then get the Suns <hi>Azimuth</hi> by the ſaid Book 4.27, when you can, and at the ſame time Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve by your <hi>Label</hi> the Suns Horizontal diſtance from the Pole of the plain, and by comparing theſe together you may eaſily gather the Declination of the Wall: as in Example.</p>
               <p>I obſerved the Sun to be gone Weſt from the Pole of the plain 70 degrees, and by the Altitude of the Sun then taken, I found his <hi>Azimuth</hi> 60 degrees: here I reaſon thus, The Sun is gone from the Pole and Vertical of the Wall 70 degrees, and from the Meridian but 60 degrees, therefore the Meridian lies between the Pole of the plain and the Sun and becauſe ☉ <hi>p</hi> is 70. and ☉ S 60. therefore S <hi>p</hi> the Declination of the plain, is 10 degrees the difference of 70. and 60, and the Declination is Eaſt, for the Sun is neerer to the Meridian then to the Vertical of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:101831:91"/>the plain: and thus if you draw a rude Scheam of your Caſe, you may ſoon reaſon out the Declination, better then do it blind-fold by the rules commonly given.</p>
               <p>And by theſe two laſt wayes you may take the Declination, not only of upright plains, but of Recliners alſo, for which the firſt way will not ſerve,</p>

               <p>But Declining Dyals which look awry from our Meridian, have a Meridian of their own, which is called the Meridian of the plain, and the Subſtyle (becauſe the <hi>Style</hi> or <hi>Gnomor</hi> ſtands upon it) and is indeed the Meridian of that Place, where this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Dyal would be a Vertical Dyal, and where the Subſtyle
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:101831:91"/>would be the Noon line: and to this Subſtyle the hours of the plain are alwayes ſo conformed, that the nearer they be to the Subſtyle the narrower are the hour ſpaces, and contrarily: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Meridians do ſo cut every oblique Horizon, that is, thickeſt near the Meridian of the place: and this Declining Dyal (being a ſtranger with us) followeth the faſhion of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and ſo hath his narroweſt hour ſpaces near his own Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, rather then ours Now as that is the Meridian of our place which cutteth our Horizon at Right angles, paſſing through his Poles <hi>Zenith</hi> and <hi>Nadir,</hi> ſo the Meridian of any plain is that which cutteth the plain at Right angles, and paſſeth through his Poles.</p>
               <p>You may find all theſe requiſites in the Meridional Projection, not only for one, but for all Declinations, lying as in a Table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, with admirable eaſe and delight; for there is no Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Wall or Horizontal plain, but we have an <hi>Azimuth</hi> in the <hi>Reet</hi> which ſhall picture him: and look how the Meridians di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide theſe <hi>Azimuths,</hi> ſo do they divide the Horizons or Circles of the Declining plains. The Pole of any <hi>Azimuth</hi> is found in the <hi>Finitor</hi> 90 degrees diſtant from him; the Meridian that cuts the Pole of the <hi>Azimuth,</hi> cuts alſo the <hi>Azimuth,</hi> and the plain thereby repreſented at Right angles, and is the Meridian of the plain or Subſtylar, (Chapter 2. Theorem 11.) and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of that Meridian between the plain and the next Pole of the World are the Elevation of the Pole above the plain: and ſo the Elevation of the <hi>Gnomon</hi> or <hi>Style,</hi> and the arch of the plain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended between this Meridian of the plain and the <hi>Limb,</hi> is the Declination of the <hi>Gnomon,</hi> or diſtance of the Subſtyle from the Meridian, or diſtance of the Meridian of the plain from the Meridian of the Place. What would you more?</p>
               <p>Example. If a Wall Decline Eaſt 30 degrees. I ſay, becauſe the face of the Wall looketh 30 degrees from the South Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, therefore the plain, which lieth 90 degrees from his Pole, is in the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Azimuth</hi> from the Eaſt Northward: therefore I go to the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

               <p>THe Baſe or Horizontal line of ſuch a Dyal lieth in the Eaſt <hi>Azimuth,</hi> and his Pole in the Meridian; as you may ſee in the plain of the former Chapter. In the Meridional Projection having ſet the <hi>Finitor</hi> to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, count from the <hi>Zenith</hi> the degrees of Reclination North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or South-ward as you obſerved it to be, and remove the <hi>Zenith</hi> ſo many degrees the ſame way, then ſhall you ſee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently which Pole is Elevated above the <hi>Zenith</hi> line, (for that is the picture of your plain) and how much: to which Elevation you ſhall make your Dyal by the tenth Chapter, remembring to turn the <hi>Gnomon</hi> upwards or downwards as the North or South Pole is Elevated above the face of your plain.</p>
               <p>Example. The plain of the former Chapter was a North plain Reclining Southward 50 degrees, that is, almoſt to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial: when the <hi>Finitor</hi> is at our Latitude the <hi>Zenith</hi> is diſtant from the North Pole the Complement thereof 37.45. toward the South. Now I muſt put the <hi>Zenith</hi> yet 50 degrees more Southward, becauſe my plain Reclines ſo much that way, and I ſee that then the North Pole is Elevated 87. 45. minutes, and I ſee upon the <hi>Zenith</hi> line or Axis of the <hi>Reet</hi> how the hour Circles cut my plain almoſt in equal ſpaces: if this plain had Reclined but 2. 15 minutes further, he had fallen into the plain of the Equinoctial, and ſo the Dyal would have been a Polar Dyal, and all the hours would have had equal ſpace, and the

                  <hi>Gnomon</hi> would have ſtood Perpendicular, which are the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Polar Dyal, as hath been ſhewed Chapter 4.</p>

               <p>AS it hath been ſhewed Chapter 14, that the baſe or Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal line of a South Recliner lieth alwayes in the Eaſt <hi>Azimuth,</hi> ſo the baſe of an Eaſt Recliner lieth alwayes in the Meridian of the Place. And as all Declining plains lie in ſome <hi>Azimuth,</hi> and croſs one another in the <hi>Zenith</hi> and <hi>Nadir,</hi> by Chapter 12. ſo theſe Reclining plains lie in ſome Circle of Poſition, and croſs one another in the North and South points of the Horizon: which being conſidered, thoſe Eaſt Recliners ſhall be made as eaſily as the Decliners Chapter 12.</p>
               <p>For theſe Eaſt Recliners be in very deed South Decliners to thoſe that live 90 degrees from us Northward or Southward; and have one of the Poles Elevated as much as the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Latitude: for the Perpendicular or Plumb-line of thoſe People is Parallel to the Horizontal Diameter of our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian.</p>
               <p>In the Meridional Projection, ſet the <hi>Zenith</hi> line to the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and then are the <hi>Azimuths</hi> Circles of Poſition, and are alſo thoſe very Eaſt or Weſt Reclining plains, and the <hi>Zenith</hi> line is the baſe or Horizontal line to them all, and to the Meridian like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; Take any of theſe <hi>Azimuths,</hi> and ſee how the Meridians of the <hi>Mater</hi> divide him, ſo ſhall the Dyal-plain repreſented by it be divided alſo. The working is very like that of Chapter 12. Compare the one with the other where you doubt.</p>
               <p>Example. I have an Eaſt plain Reclining 45 degrees, to which I would make a Dyal. I ſet the <hi>Zenith</hi> line to the Latitude 52. 15 minutes and going to the arch of the 45 <hi>Azimuth</hi> on one ſide the <hi>Zenith</hi> line, and his match ſo many degrees diſtant on the other ſide, I take that Circle for my plain, his Center is the Center of the Planiſphear: the Meridian or Noon line of the Place in theſe Dyals is evermore the Axis or Zenith line of the <hi>Reet,</hi> for he is drawn to the Interſection of the Meridian of the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:101831:94"/>Place (here the <hi>Limb</hi>) with the plain. The <hi>Zenith</hi> line here lies Horizontal, therefore the Noon line in theſe Eaſt Recliners muſt be evermore the Horizontal line of the Dyal, as in all Decliners (Chapter 12.) the Noon line is evermore the Vertical or Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular line.</p>
               <p>The arch of my plain which is neareſt to the North Pole hath his Pole in the <hi>Finitor</hi> 45 degrees from the Center Southward, and there this Pole is cut by the Meridian 31 ¼. from the Axis, this is the Meridian of my plain, and he is diſtant from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian of the Place 58 ¾. (which is the difference of Longitude) this Meridian I follow to the arch of the plain which is neareſt to the North Pole, and ſo going on in him to the Pole I number in him between the plain and the Pole 34 degrees, which is the Elevation of the Pole, and therefore alſo of the <hi>Gnomon</hi> above this plain: and between this Meridian of the plain and the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the Place at <hi>Zenith</hi> I reckon in the plain 42 ½ for the Declination of the <hi>Gnomon.</hi>
               </p>

               </figure>
               <p>Then I ſeek my hour diſtances, and I find the firſt hour-circle from the Meridian toward the Subſtyle cuts in the plain 14 ½, therefore taking 14 ½ in the blind arch from the Noon line to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Subſtyle, I ſet 11. for ſo it is, and not 1. as you may perſently perceive, if you hold but a Book or a Trencher after the Situation of your plain, ſomewhat near by gueſs, and conſider which way the ſhadow muſt move, reaſon will tell you it moves downward in this Dyal from 11. to 12. &amp;c. then I ſee the ſecond hour-circle cuts the plain at 25 ½ for 10. the next at 34 ⅔. for 9. the next at 43. for 8. which happneth a little above the Subſtyle, as he ought, for the difference of Longitude is almoſt 60. <hi>viz</hi> 58 ¾. as before, next 51 ½. for 7. next 61 ⅓ for 6. next 73 ⅓ for 5. next 88 ½ for 4. and further I need not go in our Country.</p>
               <p>Then in the other arch of the plain I find 19 ½ for 1.45 for 2. 71 for 3. and theſe I put in their places, as in the Figure. The <hi>Gnomon</hi> muſt ſtand ſquare upon the Subſtyle, at an angle of 34 degrees.</p>
               <p>Note that the Reclination muſt alwayes be reckoned from the <hi>Limb</hi> inwards upon the <hi>Finitor,</hi> becauſe where the <hi>Finitor</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the <hi>Limb</hi> there is our <hi>Zenith</hi> for this turn. Inclination is reckoned from the <hi>Zenith</hi> line, which here is both the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Horizon, and Horizon itſelf.</p>
               <p>For the Oppoſite or Inclining face of this Dyal-plain, uſe the general way I ſhewed you, Chapter 12. that is, ſtrike the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyle and all the hour lines through the Center: and ſet the ſame figures to every hour line beyond the Center which he had on this ſide, and ſet the <hi>Gnomon</hi> upon the Subſtyle downward to behold the South Pole, and it is done. And ſo by the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Dyal, if you had him firſt drawn, you might preſently make the Recliner.</p>

               <p>I adviſe you therefore firſt to draw (though it be but by aime) an Horizontal Projection of the Sphear, ſuch as here I have drawn for a South Dyal Declining Weſt 50 degrees, and Recli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning 60 degrees in the Latitude 52. 10. minutes, which ſhall be our Example.</p>

               <p>It is true that the laſt Triangle alone may do your work, or the two firſt may do it without the laſt: but you ſhall do well to be acquainted with them all.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Triangle D N O you have given D N 40 degrees the Complement of the plains Declination, N the Right angle of our Meridian with our Horizon, D the Complement of Recli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, whereby you may find D O the Oblique Aſcenſion of our Meridian; that is, how many degrees of the plain the noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line ſhall lie above the Horizontal line: alſo you may find N O the Perpendicular Altitude of the noon-line, or the Inclination of the noon-line of the Dyal to the Horizon; (where you ſhall note that when this Altitude of the noon-line N O is equal to N P the Elevation of the Pole, then is the ſecond Triangle P R O quite loſt in the point P, and the plain then becometh a Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Equinoctial plain) alſo you may find the angle O called the Poſition-Reclination for a reaſon hereafter to be ſhewed; <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tekindus</hi> calls it, <hi>Complementum repetendum,</hi> becauſe he means to have a Bout with it again, to find other arches by it.</p>

               <p>In the Third Triangle P Z H, you have given P Z the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your Latitude, Z H the Complement of the plains Reclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Z the Supplement of the plains Declination.</p>

               <p>Every arch and angle therefore in theſe Triangles is given, or may preſently be found by the Problemes of Spherical Triangles, Book 3.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall ſhew you a ſhort and pleaſant way to find them, by ſetting the whole Scheam at once on your Planiſphear, where you ſhall have them almoſt all at one view.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe I uſe my Planiſphear in the Horizontal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. But note, that I make uſe onely of the <hi>Reet</hi> and <hi>Label,</hi> and one of the Meridians of the <hi>Mater.</hi>

               <p>And by this time I ſee my three Triangles on my Planiſphear,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:101831:97"/>their ſides divided into degrees, as a Carpenters Rule into Inches. and I find for the Latitude 52. 10. minutes, that D O the Oblique Aſcenſion of the Meridian is 44.06.</p>
               <p>N O the Altitude of the Meridian 20. 22 minutes.</p>

               </head>
               <p>TAke the eaſieſt way firſt. You have ſeen Chapter 15. how eaſily Eaſt and Weſt Reclining Dyals are to be made by the Planiſphear, becauſe they fall out to be Circles of Poſition, and are plainly pictured by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimuths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I will ſhew you how all Reclining Dyals may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Eaſt or Weſt Recliners, for ſome Latitude or other, and ſo the hour diſtances found by the Method of the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter.</p>
               <p>The Circles of Poſition, as hath been ſhewed, do all croſs one another in the North and South points of the Meridian. Now therefore by the point O where the plain cuts our Meridian, draw a new Horizon O B Q C, and then ſhall you ſee your plain in that Horizon to be a very Circle of Poſition. But now we are gotten into a new Latitude, O P called (before in Chapter 16) the Poſition Latitude, and we have here a new Reclination, for whereas this plains Reclination in our Latitude is Z D T 60 degrees, his Poſition Reclination is O, <hi>viz.</hi> Z O T, or P O R 67. 29. minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:101831:97"/>In the making of this Dyal therefore, you ſhall forget your own Latitude, and the plains Reclination in your Horizon, and with this new Latitude and Reclination make the Dyal after the manner of the Eaſt Recliner Chapter 15. not regarding the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination at all: For the Baſe of this plain is now fallen into the Horizontal line of the Meridian, and his Declination being juſt a Quadrant, he becomes a Regular Plain, and neither his Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor his Reclination ſhall now much trouble you.</p>
               <p>How to place your Noon-line from the Horizontal or Verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal line of the plain, you have found already, and at what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances every Hour ſhall ſtand from the Noon-line in the plain you ſhall thus find.</p>

                  <figDesc>diagram</figDesc>
               </figure>
               <p>Set the <hi>Zenith</hi> line of the <hi>Reet</hi> to your new Latitude P O 31. 48 minutes, and find for your plain the <hi>Azimuth</hi> 67 ½ from the Axis, becauſe P O R is 67. 29 minutes, as before: ſeek his Pole in the <hi>Finitor,</hi> which will be the 90<hi rend="sup">th</hi> degree from the ſaid <hi>Azimuth</hi> or plain, and you ſhall find that Pole cut by the 26.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:101831:98"/>Meridian: this therefore is the Meridian of my plain, and ſhall make the Sub-ſtyle on the Dyal: his diſtance from the Meridian of the Place in the Equinoctial is 26. and ſo much is the angle O P R the difference of Longitude, as before: then follow this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian of your plain to that arch of the plain which is next the Pole of the World, and you ſhall number from the plain to the Pole in the ſaid Meridian 29. 08 minutes for the Elevation of the <hi>Gnomon</hi> P R, as before: and from this Meridian to the Meridian of the Place at the <hi>Zenith</hi> you ſhall number in the plain 13. 21 minutes for O R, the Declination of the <hi>Gnomon,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Now the croſſing of the plain with the Meridian of the Place is the Noon-point in the plain, and that in this caſe is alwayes in the <hi>Zenith,</hi> and I ſee the reſt of the Meridians cutting the plain for the Morning Hours, thus.</p>

               <p>THere is no Declining plain but at ſome certain Reclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cutteth through the Poles of the World and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh a Right Horizon. Therefore to find whither a Declining Reclining plain do happen to be a Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Equinoctial plain, you ſhall obſerve what the Elevation of the Noon-line N O is; for if that be equal to N P the Latitude, then doth the plain cut the Poles, otherwiſe not: And at what Reclination any Decliner ſhall cut the Poles, and ſo have the Altitude of his Noon line equal to the Latitude, you ſhall thus find.</p>
               <p>Uſe the <hi>Reet</hi> and <hi>Label</hi> in the Horizontal Projection as you did Chapter 16. that is, ſet the Horizontal line of the plain D <hi>d</hi> on the Axis of the <hi>Reet,</hi> then number from the <hi>Zenith</hi> in the <hi>Limb</hi> of the <hi>Reet</hi> the Complement of the Declination, and thereto lay the <hi>Label,</hi> and having made a prick with ink in the <hi>Label</hi> for the Pole (52 ¼ from the <hi>Limb</hi>) mark which of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimuths</hi> cutteth that Pole for he ſheweth you at what Reclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Decliner ſhall cut the Pole and fall into the plain of one of the Maridians.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:101831:99"/>Sight; and for P you may find him if you turn the Triangle as Book 3. hath been ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Example.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:101831:101"/>plain; and then to find the Meridian of your Place, number from the <hi>Limb</hi> in the <hi>Finitor</hi> the Declination of the <hi>Gnomon,</hi> and the Meridian cutting there is the Meridian of your place, and ſtands for Noon: therefore every 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Meridian numbred from hence (and not from the <hi>Limb</hi> in this Caſe) is an Hour line for your Dyal: and look at what diſtance from the <hi>Limb</hi> they cut the <hi>Finitor,</hi> at the ſame diſtance from the Sub-ſtyle ſhall the Hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines be ſet in your Dyal plain.</p>
               <p>Example. I have a South plain Erect Declining 30. degrees Eaſtward, (as in Chapter 12.)</p>
               <p>And for this, Firſt I ſet the <hi>Zenith</hi> 30 degrees from <hi>Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> toward <hi>Oriens,</hi> and ſo doth the <hi>Finitor</hi> repreſent my plain, and I ſee the <hi>Azimuth</hi> 21.10. minutes cutting the South Pole of the Horizontal Projection about 38 degrees from the Center; from the Pole to the <hi>Finitor</hi> I number in this <hi>Azimuth</hi> 32.01. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, the Elevation of the Pole above the plain; and from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſection of this <hi>Azimuth</hi> with the <hi>Finitor</hi> to the Center where the Meridian of the Place meets, I number in the <hi>Finitor</hi> 21.10. minutes, ſo much is the Declination of the <hi>Gnomon</hi> or of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyle from the Noon line.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſetting the <hi>Finitor</hi> to the Plain's Latitude 32.01. minutes, I number from the South point of the <hi>Finitor</hi> inwards 21.10. minutes, and there cuts the Meridian 36.08. minutes from the <hi>Limb,</hi> ſhewing me the difference of Longitude, or Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ncctial diſtance of the Meridian of the Place from the Meridian of the plain; for this 36 Meridian is the Meridian of my Place, and therefore I mark him well, he is the Vertical of my Dyal, and alſo the Noon line. And here I conſider that the Sub-ſtyle will be Weſtward from him upon the plain, becauſe it Declines Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (by Chapter 2. Theorem 11.) Therefore beginning at Noon, where the 36 Meridian cutteth the <hi>Finitor</hi> I go 15. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Limb,</hi> and light upon the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Meridian from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyle for 11 a clock, and he cutteth the <hi>Finitor</hi> at 11.35. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes from the <hi>Limb:</hi> ſo the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Hour is the ſixt Meridian on this ſide the <hi>Limb,</hi> and cutteth the <hi>Finitor</hi> 3.16. minutes: the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Hour is the ninth Meridian beyond the <hi>Limb,</hi> as you come back again, and cutteth the <hi>Finitor</hi> at 4.44. minutes from the <hi>Limb</hi> or Sub-ſtyle on the other ſide (that is, Weſtward of the Sub-ſtyle in the Dyal.) In like manner you may gather the diſtances of the other Hour lines from the Sub-ſtyle into a Table, and thereby plot them down as in the Figure.</p>

How to draw the Hours of our Country on ſuch a plain is the harder work, becauſe the plain is Irregular to our Horiz on: yet I ſuppoſe I have made the way very eaſy in the former Chapters. But to draw the Hours of the Country to which the plain belongs, is moſt eaſy. For if you take the Sub-ſtylar for the Noon-line,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:101831:102"/>and the Elevation of the Pole above the plain for the Latitude, you may make this Dyal in all points like the Vertical Dyal, after the precept of the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter.</p>

               <p>The Circles fitteſt to be projected in all Dyals for thoſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes are the Equator with the <hi>Tropiques</hi> and other his Parallels; which may be accounted Parallels of Declination, as they paſs through equal degrees, as every 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Declination: or Parallels of the Signes, as they paſs through ſuch degrees of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination

               <p>Having therefore drawn the <hi>Azimuths</hi> or <hi>Almicantars</hi> of your plain by Chapter 27, take your Planiſphear in the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Projection, ſetting the <hi>Finitor</hi> to the Latitude of your plain; Then find your Equator and Parallels on the <hi>Mater,</hi> and where the ſeveral Hour lines interſect them above the <hi>Finitor,</hi> mark what <hi>Azimuth</hi> or rather what <hi>Almicantar</hi> paſſeth through theſe interſections; for in the ſame <hi>Azimuth</hi> and <hi>Almicantar</hi> ſhall the Parallels cut the Hour lines of the plain upon the plain.</p>
               <p>Example. In the Vertical Dyal for our Latitude 52.15. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, I ſet the <hi>Finitor</hi> to this Latitude, and going firſt to the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pique</hi> of <hi>Cancer,</hi> I begin at the <hi>Limb,</hi> that is, at Noon, there I ſee the <hi>Azimuth</hi> full South the Altitude 61.15. minutes, at 1. a clock: <hi>Azimuth</hi> 27. <hi>Altitude</hi> 59. at 2. <hi>Azimuth</hi> 49 ½. <hi>Altitude</hi> 53 ⅓ at 3. <hi>Azimuth</hi> 67. <hi>Altitude</hi> 45 ½. &amp;c. Therefore where I find the Noon line of my plain cut by the <hi>Almicantar</hi> 61 ¼, I make a prick, and in the Hour lines of 11 and of 1. where the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimuth</hi> 27 and the <hi>Almicantar</hi> 59 meet, I make pricks, and where the <hi>Azimuth</hi> 49 ½ and the <hi>Almicantar</hi> 53 ⅓ do meet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Hour lines of 10.2. I make pricks, and ſo for the reſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly I draw with an even hand a crooked line without angles through thoſe pricks, and that ſhall be the Parallel or <hi>Tropique</hi> of <hi>Cancer:</hi> and in like manner I put in all the other Parallels, and the Equator in the midſt of them, though for the Equator you may draw him more ſpeedily by ſtriking a line through the Center of the <hi>Almicantars</hi> making Right angles with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyle. And that may be a general Rule for the Equator in all Dyals which have a Subſtyle, and in the Polar Dyal where there is no Subſtyle, the Equator ſhall be a Circle, as before is ſhewn.</p>
               <p>Note here that if your Dyal be great, and you have not points enough to govern you in the draught of the Conical ſections you may draw half-hour-lines, and find points in them alſo, after the ſame manner.</p>

               <p>IF you like not to draw the proper Dyal of the plain where it Declines or Reclines, becauſe being uſeleſs in your Country it muſt be wiped out again, it ſhall ſuffice you to find the Hour lines of your Country upon the plain by Chapter 21, and 22 and in the poſture your Planiſphear hath in thoſe Chapters to obſerve what <hi>Almicantars</hi> or <hi>Azimuths</hi> do croſs thoſe Hour lines at the ſeveral Hours in any Parallel, and thereby make pricks upon the Hour lines of your Place, as in the former Chapter you did upon the Hour lines of your plain; and by theſe pricks you may draw your Parallels as before.</p>
               <p>Note that if you work this way, you ſhall find the Suns great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Altitude to be in the Meridian of the plain or Subſtyle, and not in the Noon-line of your Place; whereat you muſt not wonder: ſo if the Subſtyle be about 9 in the Morning there you ſhall find the Sun at higheſt, and that his Altitude decreaſeth from thence till he leaves the plain.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe <hi>Nodus</hi> may be choſen in any part of the <hi>Gnomon,</hi> but with the eaution given Chapter 27. and a Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular falling from the <hi>Nodus</hi> on the Sub-ſtyle ſhall touch the Center of the <hi>Azimuths</hi> and <hi>Almicantars</hi> of the plain, as hath been ſhewed Chapter 27.</p>
               <p>Here you have no uſe of thoſe <hi>Azimuths</hi> and <hi>Almicantars:</hi> but through the Center of them you ſhall draw an Horizontal line by Chapter 3. and that ſhall be Horizon.</p>
               <p>Now if your plain Decline not from the Meridian, and ſo this Center fall upon the Noon line, you ſhall divide your Horizon both wayes from the Center, as you were taught to divide the <hi>Azimuthal</hi> lines by <hi>Tangents,</hi> Chapter 27. and ſhall number
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:101831:107"/>thoſe diviſions from the Center on both ſides 5, 10, 15, 20. &amp;c. and from the ſeveral points ſo made for 5, 10, 15, &amp;c. In the Horizontal line let fall Perpendiculars or Vertical lines on the plain, and they ſhall be <hi>Azimuths</hi> of your Place.</p>
               <p>But if your plain Decline you ſhall divide the Horizontal line thus. Draw a ſhort Vertical line through the ſaid Center down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, by Chapter 3. which ſhall be the Verticle of your plain.</p>

               <p>For the <hi>Almicantars</hi> they will not be ſo handſome lines, but if
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:101831:108"/>you will have them, do thus. If the plain Decline not, ſet the <hi>Finitor</hi> to the Latitude of your Place, as Chapter 10. and if it De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, ſet the <hi>Finitor</hi> to the Latitude of your plain as Chapter 21. Then keeping your ey above the Horizon, and within the <hi>Tropiques,</hi> mark what Hour lines the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Almicantar</hi> (for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) cutteth, and what <hi>Azimuth</hi> there with him cutteth the ſame Hour lines alſo, and in the interfections of the ſame <hi>Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muths</hi> and Hour lines upon your plain you ſhall make marks, through which the tenth <hi>Almicantar</hi> ſhall be drawn: and ſo of the reſt.</p>
               <p>Note here That your <hi>Azimuths</hi> and <hi>Almicantars</hi> muſt not be drawn beyond the <hi>Tropiques,</hi> nor beyond the Horizon: neither muſt the Hour lines, if the <hi>Nodus</hi> be the end of the <hi>Gnomon.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIII.</hi> How by the help of this Furniture to place any moveable <hi>Dyal-Plain</hi> in his true Situation, and conſequently to find the <hi>Meridian-line</hi> of the <hi>Place,</hi> without any other <hi>Inſtrument</hi> then the <hi>Dyal</hi> it ſelf.</head>
               <p>SEt the Dyal upon a level Table or Board, and turn it till the ſhadow of the <hi>Nodus</hi> touch the Suns <hi>Parallel, Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth,</hi> or <hi>Almicantar,</hi> any or all of them: but the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel ſhall beſt guide you, becauſe that is moſt eaſily known by memory without Obſervation. And when the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the <hi>Nodus</hi> toucheth the Suns Parallel it ſhews there the Hour alſo; and moreover it ſhews the Suns Altitude and <hi>Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth</hi> for the ſame Time if the <hi>Azimuths</hi> and <hi>Almicantars</hi> alſo be drawn upon your Dyal.</p>
               <p>But you ſhall note here, that the ſhadow of the <hi>Nodus</hi> may touch the Parallel at like diſtance from the Sub-ſtyle on both ſides. Therefore if you be in doubt which is the true place of touching (as you may well doubt when the ſhadow cuts the Parallel near the Sub-ſtyle) you ſhall Obſerve a while whether the ſh dow of the <hi>Radius</hi> be lengthning or ſhortning: If it ſhorten, the Sun is not come to the Sub-ſtyle, and ſo the earlyer
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:101831:108"/>Hour ſhewed is the true Hour; If it lengthen, the Sun is paſt the Sub-ſtyle, and the later Hour is the true Hour. And when the Dyal ſhews the true Hour, the <hi>Gnomon</hi> and the plains Parallel thereto do point North and South. And here you may ſee, that the further the Sun is from the Sub-ſtyle, the more eaſily is the Dyal placed.</p>
               <p>Thus may you make a very commodious Polar Dyal, to ſtand in a chamber Window, and to remove from Window to Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow as the Sun goes, which ſhall find the Meridian line it ſelf any where, in the 4. <hi>Summer</hi> and 4. <hi>Winter</hi> Moneths; and if you will make him a <hi>Limb,</hi> like the <hi>Limb</hi> of a Box-lid of a Cheeſe-fat, to receive the Parallels near the Equinoctial, which elſe fall beyond the plain, he ſhall ſerve for all the Year.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIV.</hi> How to make a <hi>Vertical Dyal</hi> upon the <hi>Ceeling</hi> of a <hi>Floor</hi> within Dores, where the <hi>Direct Beams</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> never come.</head>
               <p>THe greateſt part and as much as you ſhall uſe of the Vertical Dyal deſcribed Chapter 9. may by Reflection be turned upſide down, and placed upon a Ceeling, but the Center will be in the Air without Dores.</p>
               <p>A peece of a Looking-glaſs as broad as a Groat or Six-pence ſet level, or a Gally-pot of fair Water, which will ſet it ſelf level, being placed upon the ſole of the Window ſhall ſupply the uſe of the <hi>Nodus</hi> in the <hi>Gnomon,</hi> and the beams of the Sun being Reflected by this Glaſs or Water ſhall ſhew the Hours upon the Ceeling.</p>
               <p>The Planiſphear ſhall help you to make this Dyal two wayes. If the Window Decline not much from the South, you may make it moſt eaſily the Firſt way. But if it Decline much, and ſo the lines fall much upon the partition Walls, or if you would adorn this Dyal with the Parallels or other Circles, you ſhall uſe the Second way.</p>
               <p>The Firſt way is this Draw a Meridian line upon the Floor. by Book 4.3. ſo that it may point upon the Perpendicular, which you ſhall imagine to fall from the <hi>Nodus</hi> upon the plain of the Floor prolonged. And this may be moſt eaſily done, if you
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:101831:109"/>hang a Plumb-line in the Window dnecuy over the <hi>Nodus</hi> of place of the Glais, for the ſhadow which that Plumb-line gives upon the Floor at Noon, is the Meridian line ſought; and by a Ruler or a line ſtretched upon it you may prolong it as far as you ſhall need.</p>
               <p>Then let a Plumb line fall from the Ceeling upon this Meridian line of the Floor, and behind it Northward or Southward, place your Ey, ſo that the Plumb-line may hide the Meridian line of the Floor from your Ey: then keeping your head ſteddy, caſt you: Ey up to the Ceeling, and direct One to make two points at a good diſtance, in the line upon the Ceeling which the Plumb-line now covereth from your Ey, and by theſe points you ſhall draw a ſtraight Meridian on the Ceeling.</p>
               <figure>
                  <figDesc>diagram</figDesc>
               </figure>
               <p>Then having faſtned one end of a Line at <hi>Nodus,</hi> let Another ſtretch this line up to the Meridian on the Ceeling, and let him move his hand nearer or further in the Meridian till you find by a Quadrant that this line pointeth up Northward as many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees as the Elevation of the Equator is in your Country, and then you ſhall cauſe him to make a point where the line toucheth
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:101831:109"/>the Meridian of the Cieling, and through that point you ſhall draw the Equinoctial line of your Dyal, cutting the ſaid Meridian at Right angles. The length of the thred from the <hi>Nodus</hi> to the point in the Meridian where the Equinoctial cuts him, is <hi>Radius</hi> of the Equinoctial: to that <hi>Radius</hi> you ſhall find the <hi>Tangents</hi> of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75. as you found the <hi>Co-tangents</hi> Chapter 27. (knowing that the <hi>Co-tangents</hi> of 80, and 70. be the <hi>Tangents</hi> of 10, and 20, and ſo of the reſt) and beginning in the Meridian make pricks in the Equinoctial line, at the end of the <hi>Tangent</hi> of 15. Eaſtward for 1. and Weſtward for 11. and at the end of the <hi>Tangent</hi> of 30. prick Eaſtward 2. and Weſtward 10. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Then by Chapter 9. ſeek what angles the Hour lines of a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Dyal make at the Center, which in our Latitude are 1.11.58. minutes, 2.24.32. minutes, 3.38.20. minutes, 4.53.52. minutes, 5.71.17. minutes, and with the Complements of theſe angles ſhall theſe Hour lines croſs the Equinoctial: ſo the Hour line of 1. ſhall Incline to the Meridian on the South ſide the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial line, and ſhall make his leſſer angle with the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial 78.02. minutes, and the reſt as in the Figure.</p>
               <p>The Second way is this. Fit a plain ſmooth Board about a foot Square to lie level from the fole of the Window inwards, and near the outer edge thereof make a Center in the board in the very place of <hi>Nodus,</hi> or a little under it, remembring that the <hi>Nodus</hi> or Center of the Glaſs muſt be ſet ſo much higher then this board, as the Center of your Quadrant is placed higher in the Projecting of the Dyal.</p>
               <p>Upon that Center taken in the board deſcribe as much of a Circle as you may with the Semidiameter of your Quadrant; which Circle ſhall be Horizon: Draw here from the Center to the Horizon inwards a Meridian line, by Book 4.3. and where it cuts the Horizon begin to graduate the Horizon into degrees of <hi>Azimuths</hi> both wayes, which you may ſpeedily do, by transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the graduations of your Quadrant, or ſo much as you ſhall need, to this Horizon.</p>
               <p>Next you muſt deviſe to make your Quadrant ſtand firm and upright upon one of his ſtraight ſides, (which I will call his foot for this time) and that you may thus do; Take a ſhort peece of a Ruler or ſinal Tranſom, and ſaw in one ſide of it a notch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perdicularly, in which notch you may ſtick faſt or wedge the heel or the toe of your Quadrant, in ſuch ſort that his foot may come
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:101831:110"/>cloſe to the board, and the other ſtraight ſide or leg may ſtand Perpendicular upon it.</p>
               <p>Thoſe things prepared, put your Planiſphear in the Meridional Projection, with the <hi>Finitor</hi> at your Latitude, and firſt obſerve there the Altitudes of the Sun in the Meridian, which in Latitude 52.15. minutes, you ſhall find in the <hi>Tropique</hi> of ♋ 61.15. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, in the Equator 37.45. minutes, and in the <hi>Tropique</hi> of ♑ 14.15. minutes. Now having ſtuck a ſhort needle in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Horizon, cloſe to which you muſt alwayes keep the Center of your Quadrant, ſet the foot of your Quadrant in the Meridian line of the Board, and from the Center of your Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant extend a thred by 14.15. minutes of Altitude ſtraight on to the Cieling (the thred only touching the plain of the Quadrant and making no angle with it, but held Parallel) and where the thred thus extended touches the Cieling make a point, then the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant unmoved, extend the thred by 61.15. minutes of Altitude, and make another point as before, and between theſe two points draw a ſtraight line, and that ſhall be your Meridian, and ſhall be long enough for your uſe: then extend the thred by 37.45. minutes of Altitude, and where it touches this Meridian croſs the Meridian at Right angles with an infinite line, which ſhall be the Equator. Then ſeek upon your Planiſphear for one a clock, and you ſhall find in the <hi>Tropique</hi> of ♑ the Suns <hi>Azimuth</hi> 14. and his Altitude 13.06. In the <hi>Tropique</hi> of ♋ his <hi>Azimuth</hi> 27½ and his Altitude 59.04. minutes: therefore ſetting the foot of the Quadrant in the <hi>Azimuth</hi> 14. from the Meridian Eaſtward, I extend the thred by 13.06. of Altitude, and make a prick in the Cieling: and again ſetting the foot of the Quadrant in <hi>Azimuth</hi> 27 ½. and extending the thred by 59.04 minutes of Altitude, I make another prick in the Cieling, and the ſtraight line which I ſhall draw between theſe two pricks ſhall be all the Hourlines of One, and ſo of the reſt. And if you be minded to have the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parallels drawn, you may find points for them as you have done for the <hi>Tropiques,</hi> and by thoſe points draw them. And note that two points made in the Cieling for the ſame Hour line in any two Parailels, or in the Equator and any Parallel, ſhall ſuffice to direct the line, though it is beſt to take your points in the <hi>Tropiques,</hi> at the largeſt diſtance, as I have here done, if there be room enough on the Cieling.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it often happens that part of your Dyal falls beſide
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:101831:110"/>the Cieling, and the plain of the Cieling and of the Walls is often interrupted, and made Irregular by Beams, Wal-plates, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, Wainſcot, Chimney-peeces, and ſuch like bodyes, I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n the Cieling, as you where taught before, and fix it there, and extend another thred in like manner to the <hi>Tropique</hi> of <hi>Copricorn,</hi> where ever it ſhall happen, (as perhaps beyond the middle beam, or quite beyond the Cieling upon the Wall) and fix that thred al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Then place your Ey ſo behind theſe threds that one of them may cover the other, and at the ſame inſtant where the upper line (to your Sight or Imagination) cuts the Cieling, Beams, Wall, or any Regular or Irregular body, above the end of the lower line, there ſhall the Hour line paſs from <hi>Tropique</hi> to <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pique:</hi> direct any By-ſtander to make marks as many as you ſhall need; and by theſe marks draw the Hour line according to your deſire.</p>
               <p>If the arch of the Horizon between the <hi>Tropiques</hi> be within view of your Window, you ſhall draw the ſame on the Wall to bound the Parallels, the Horizons Altitude you know is nothing, and therefore he will be a level line; and the Suns <hi>Azimuth</hi> when he riſeth (commonly called <hi>Amplitude,</hi> and <hi>Ortive Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>) is in <hi>Cancer</hi> 40.40. minutes Eaſt Northward, and in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn</hi> as much Southward; and theſe will be reflected to the contrary coaſts on the Dyal.</p>

            <p>THe Croſſ-ſtaff conſiſteth of two Rules joyned (by a ſoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, or elſe pinned) in the form of a <hi>Romane</hi> T, and three Sights, or more.</p>
            <p>The longer Ruler is called <hi>Radius, Index,</hi> and the <hi>Yard,</hi> as A B, of which I call A the neer end, B the further end. The breadth would be ¾ of an inch, the depth an inch and half, the length 70, or 80. inches: and every of thoſe inches would be divided by Parallels and Diagonal lines into 100. equal parts.</p>
            <p>The ſhorter Ruler E F is called the Tranſom; it would be half an inch or three quarters, both in breadth and depth, and in length about 2. foot: for the Sights there, if I may adviſe you, would never be ſet above 20, inches aſunder.</p>
            <p>This Tranſom would be divided into whole inches onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in the midſt at B in the viſual line ☉ B. and numbred to 10 both wayes.</p>
            <p>The Sights C and D muſt have ſockets at the bottom, through which the Tranſom muſt paſs, ſo that the Sights may be ſet to any diviſion of the Tranſom. The Vanes or tops of thoſe Sights muſt have onely two edges on their ſides, viſible to your ey, namely thoſe edges which touch the Tranſom; and the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther edges muſt be pared away.</p>
            <p>The middle Sight at B would have half his head cut away, and a ſhoulder left, as in the Figure, and a tenon at the bottom fitted to a morteſs made in the middle of the Tranſom, that you may ſtick him in and take him out when you pleaſe, for to this morteſs you ſhall do well to fit two other moveable Sights very narrow, for obſerving the Diameter of the Moon, or the diſtance of Stars which are very neer: one may be about half an inch broad, and the other about a quarter.</p>
            <figure>
               <p>This Croſſ-ſtaff is exactly made by Mr. <hi>Anthony Thomſon,</hi> in <hi>Hoſier lane; London.</hi>

               <figDesc>depiction of a cross-staff</figDesc>
            </figure>
            <p>When you would uſe this Staff, you ſhall firſt ſet the Sights of the Tranſom to like inches, as at 10, and 10. if the angle be great, or at 5, and 5. as in the Figure they are placed: alwayes ſet them at whole inches, and at like numbers on both ſides from the middle of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom: and chooſe to place thoſe Sights ſo that your Ey-ſight may be far diſtant from them in obſerving, for ſo you may the more diſtinctly obſerve the minutes and ſeconds of the angle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Then reſting the further end of the Index upon a Wall
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:101831:112"/>or ſome device fitted for that purpoſe, put the neer end over your right ſhoulder: and ſetting your Ey to the Ey-hole, ſlip the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex backward or forward till you ſee the objects by the ſides of the Sights of the Tranſom; and mark what number the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Ey-ſight cutteth upon the Index, for that ſhall give you the angle ſought in this manner.</p>
            <p>Example. The Sights of the Tranſom being ſet at 5, and 5, that is, 10. inches aſunder, I obſerved two Steeples by their edges, and the Ey-ſight then cut upon the Index, 6625. that is, inches 66 ¼ from the Tranſom. I ſay therefore, As C B 500. to B G 6625. ſo C B Radius or 100000. to B G the Co-tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of half the angle. Here I have no more to do then to divide 662500000. by 500. or 6625000. by 5. which is an eaſy work, and the Quotient 1325000. is the Co-tangent of 4. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees 18. minutes 57. ſeconds 43. thirds, for half the angle.</p>
            <p>Note here, that if the Sights had ſtood at 10, and 10. then had the number 6625. been the very Co-tangent of half the angle: and remembring that your Radius on the Tranſom hath but 1000, actual parts, go to the Canon, and cutting off ſo many places as may leave the Radius there but 1000. you ſhall find your number 6625, to be the Co-tangent of 8. 35 minutes.</p>
            <p>Note alſo, that you may obſerve the angle between the middle Sight and one of the other: and then you find the Co-tangent of the whole angle to that Radius to which your Sight is ſet on the Tranſom, as to the Radius 200. 300. or any other even hundred to 1000.</p>
            <p>Note further, that you muſt evermore obſerve neer the tops of your Sights, that the viſual lines may run above the Tranſom as much as the Ey is placed above the plain of it.</p>
            <p>He that will, may have room to ſet ſeveral Scales of degrees and minutes to ſeveral Radiuſſes; as one to the Radius 300. ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to 500. another to 700. by which the very degrees and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes may be preſently had, without recourſe to the Tables. To me the Scale of equal parts is in ſtead of all.</p>

            <p n="2">2. The Ey-ſight being made to ſhew the angle by the length of the Co-tangents, ſhall alwayes give you large differences: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that if your Staff be but 6. foot long you may obſerve to Seconds, and Thirds in leſſer angles, and till you come beyond 20. degrees, your Sight ſhall ſeldom move leſs then the tenth part of an inch for one minute. And beyond 30. or 40. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees this Inſtrument would not be uſed, becauſe the Ey cannot ſee both the Sights of the Tranſom at once, without rolling from one to another, whereby the Center of Viſion is changed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Your Ey is better fixed and ſhadowed by this Ey-ſight, then when the end of the Index is placed by gueſs upon the Cheek-bone.</p>
            <p>The inconvenience here is no more then what is found in all Croſſ-ſtaffes of what form ſoever. And that is, they are ſubject to ſome errour by reaſon of the Eccentricity of the Ey. For the viſual Beams meet within the Ey at a depth uncertain, and they are alſo refracted in the Superficies of the apple of the Ey: the apple of the Ey alſo is not of the ſame convexity, nor of the ſame breadth in all Men: and it is contracted in a bright Air, and dilated in a darker Air; as you ſhall ſoon find if you go about to obſerve the Diameter of the Moon by this Inſtrument, without correction of the Eccentricity; for you ſhall alwayes find the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Diameter too great, and much greater in the Night, then in the Day. Thus, <hi>November</hi> 18. 1653. I obſerved the Moons Diameter 32. minutes 06. ſeconds in the Day Time, and that Night I obſerved it 58. minutes, by reaſon of the dilatation of the apple of my Ey in the Night.</p>
            <p>This errour may be rectified two wayes. The Firſt is by examining the obſervations made with your Croſſ-ſtaff, by ſome other Inſtrument which is not ſubject to like errour. As for Example, I have deviſed to faſten an arch of a Circle containing 20. or 30. degrees to the end of a Ruler of 6. or 7. foot, and fit to it a <hi>Label</hi> with Sights, then having obſerved by my Croſſ-ſtaff the length of <hi>Orions Girdle,</hi> I will ſet my other Inſtrument to it, turning the arch toward me that I may manage the <hi>Label</hi> better, and noting the difference of the obſervations, I will find how to correct my Staff in that poſture an another time: and ſo by many obſervations I may frame a Table to correct the Eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity throughout: but my Table perhaps will not ſerve to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:101831:113"/>the eccentricity every Mans Ey, neither will a Table made for the Night ſerve me in the Day.</p>
            <p>The other way is moſt exact and certain for all Men. Make another Tranſom in all points like the firſt, but ſhorter by half, and let the diviſions thereof be into half-inches: this Tranſom muſt ride upon the Index with a ſocket, between the long Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and your Ey. Now when you obſerve, ſet the Sights of the ſhort Tranſom to the like number of half inches as the Sights of the long Tranſom ſtand at whole inches, and when you have placed your Ey-ſight ſo that you ſee the Stars upon the edges of the Sights of the long Tranſom, draw your ſhort Tranſom till you ſee the Stars by his Sights in like manner at once; then look what number is cut by the ſhort Tranſom, the double thereof is the Co-tangent of the angle: and look what the number cut by the Ey-ſight wants of that double, ſo much is the Eccentricity of your Ey in that place. This way is ſhewed by that Excellent Mathematician M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
